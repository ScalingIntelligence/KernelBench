This program should demonstrate element-wise tensor addition.
This prorgam takes two input tensors of the same shape and performs element-wise addition between them. Each input tensor has a batch size of 1 and contains 128 features. 

The model has no learnable parameters and simply acts as a direct addition operation between its inputs. Both input tensors are expected to be on the GPU (CUDA device).

Operation: Element-wise addition
Input shapes: (1, 128) for both inputs
Output shape: (1, 128)
Parameters: None
Device: CUDA (GPU)
Purpose: Simple demonstration of tensor addition
