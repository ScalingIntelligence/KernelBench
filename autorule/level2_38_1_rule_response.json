  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general, objective, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions vectorized memory access using float4. This implies a general rule about using vectorized loads/stores. So, \"The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per memory transaction.\"\n\nNext, the block size is discussed. Kernel 2 uses 1024 threads per block, which is a multiple of the warp size (32). The example given in the problem includes a rule about multiples of warp size. So, \"The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).\" Wait, 1024 is 32*32, so yes. But the example already has a similar rule. However, the reasoning also points out that larger block sizes can improve parallelism. But the rule should be about the block size being a multiple of warp size. So that's one rule.\n\nThe grid organization is 2D in Kernel 2 versus 1D in Kernel 1. The reasoning says this matches data layout better. So a rule could be: \"The kernel uses a grid organization that matches the data layout dimensions for better memory coalescing.\"\n\nThe use of --use_fast_math is mentioned. This is a compiler flag enabling faster math operations. So, \"The kernel is compiled with fast math optimizations (e.g., --use_fast_math) to approximate transcendental functions.\"\n\nReduced loop iterations due to processing four elements per iteration via vectorization. This leads to a rule: \"The kernel reduces loop iterations by processing multiple elements per loop iteration through vectorization.\"\n\nMemory access patterns with __restrict__ qualifiers. This allows the compiler to optimize by indicating no pointer aliasing. So, \"The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing.\"\n\nShared memory efficiency: optimized layout to reduce bank conflicts. The reasoning mentions shared memory is arranged to match warp-based reductions. So, \"The kernel optimizes shared memory layout to minimize bank conflicts during reductions.\"\n\nAdditionally, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses vectorization which increases arithmetic intensity. But that's more of an effect, not a rule. The rules should be actionable steps.\n\nAnother point is the use of a 2D grid. The example rules don't mention grid dimensions, but the reasoning implies that matching data layout dimensions is beneficial. So that's a valid rule.\n\nSo compiling all these, the rules would be:\n\n1. Vectorized memory access.\n2. Block size as multiple of warp size.\n3. Grid organization matching data layout.\n4. Fast math compiler flag.\n5. Reduced loop iterations via vectorization.\n6. __restrict__ qualifiers.\n7. Shared memory layout optimized for reductions.\n\nI need to ensure these are phrased as general, objective rules. Let me check each:\n\n- \"The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per memory transaction.\" Yes, general.\n\n- \"The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).\" From example 3, so similar.\n\n- \"The kernel uses a grid organization that matches the data layout dimensions for better memory coalescing.\" General.\n\n- \"The kernel is compiled with fast math optimizations (e.g., --use_fast_math) to approximate transcendental functions.\" Specific to compiler flags but general as a practice.\n\n- \"The kernel reduces loop iterations by processing multiple elements per loop iteration through vectorization.\" Combines vectorization and loop reduction.\n\n- \"The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing.\" General CUDA practice.\n\n- \"The kernel optimizes shared memory layout to minimize bank conflicts during reductions.\" Focuses on shared memory and bank conflicts.\n\nThese are all objective and can be checked in code or compilation settings. The answer should be a JSON array of these rules as strings.\n",
