REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on input and output pointers to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations by assuming no pointer aliasing.",
    "The kernel reorders thread indices to prioritize output position first, improving memory coalescing by aligning with input tensor memory layout.",
    "The kernel separates full-window and partial-window cases to avoid boundary checks in the common full-window scenario, reducing branch divergence.",
    "The kernel uses explicit loop unrolling with specified factors (e.g., #pragma unroll(4)) to increase instruction-level parallelism while balancing register pressure.",
    "The kernel precomputes loop boundaries (valid_start, valid_end) and inverse kernel size to minimize redundant calculations and conditional checks within loops.",
    "The kernel is compiled with -O3 and --use_fast_math flags to enable aggressive optimizations and faster math operations at the expense of precision."
