These rules focus on observable, deterministic optimizations in the CUDA kernels, such as loop unrolling, memory access patterns, and thread-to-output mapping strategies. The minor runtime difference was attributed to measurement noise, but the extracted rules reflect generalizable optimizations applicable to other CUDA implementations.",
