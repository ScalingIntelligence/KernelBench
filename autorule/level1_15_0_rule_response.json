  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the analysis of why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These rules focus on coalesced memory access patterns for writes, thread indexing strategies to achieve coalescing, and the prioritization of write efficiency over read efficiency when beneficial. The statements are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and can be objectively verified by examining memory access patterns and thread-block configurations.",
