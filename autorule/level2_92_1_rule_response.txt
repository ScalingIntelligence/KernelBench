REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel fuses multiple operations (GroupNorm, activation, residual addition) into a single kernel launch.",
    "The kernel reduces global memory accesses by reusing intermediate values within the same kernel instead of writing and reading them from global memory.",
    "The kernel uses shared memory for parallel reductions (e.g., mean and variance calculations in GroupNorm).",
    "The kernel employs a 2D grid layout (groups × batch) to enhance parallelism and GPU occupancy.",
    "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread using strided loops to improve computational efficiency.",
    "The kernel avoids redundant global memory reads by accessing input data (e.g., x_conv) once and reusing it for multiple computations.",
    "The kernel utilizes optimized library functions (e.g., PyTorch's native logsumexp) instead of custom implementations where possible."
