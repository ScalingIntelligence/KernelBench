  "The kernel avoids loop unrolling to reduce register pressure and improve occupancy.",
  "The kernel uses a block-wide shared memory reduction with contiguous access patterns instead of hierarchical warp-level reductions.",
  "The kernel uses a simpler loop structure without aggressive unrolling to maintain lower register usage.",
  "The kernel prioritizes occupancy over vectorized memory access by avoiding complex memory access patterns."
