REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a fast approximation (e.g., tanhf) for activation functions instead of exact computations (e.g., erff).",
    "The kernel dynamically adjusts thread block sizes based on problem size, up to the maximum allowed threads per block (e.g., 1024).",
    "The kernel employs a two-stage reduction process using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns and reduce bank conflicts.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on input pointers to enable better compiler optimizations for memory aliasing.",
    "The kernel aligns thread block sizes to warp size multiples (e.g., rounding to multiples of 32) to minimize thread divergence.",
    "The kernel stores intermediate results in shared memory for efficient reuse during subsequent reduction phases."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. These statements capture general optimization strategies applicable to CUDA kernels, such as using fast approximations, dynamic thread configuration, multi-stage reductions, memory access optimizations, and warp-aligned execution. Each rule is objectively verifiable through code inspection or profiling tools.
