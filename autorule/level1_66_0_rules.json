  "The kernel uses a multi-dimensional grid structure to group threads processing spatially adjacent output elements, improving memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel minimizes index calculation overhead by leveraging block and thread indices directly for spatial mapping.",
  "The kernel's memory access pattern ensures consecutive threads access contiguous memory locations, enabling stride-1 accesses.",
  "The kernel aligns weight tensor indexing with the memory layout to improve cache utilization.",
  "The kernel avoids flat index unraveling with division/modulo operations, reducing computational overhead and register usage."
