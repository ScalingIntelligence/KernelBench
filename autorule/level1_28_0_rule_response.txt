REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel orders clamp operations as fmaxf(fminf(...)) to allow compiler optimization into a single instruction.",
    "The kernel uses the canonical order of min followed by max for clamp operations to enable compiler recognition and optimization."

ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel orders clamp operations as fmaxf(fminf(...)) to allow compiler optimization into a single instruction.",
    "The kernel uses the canonical order of min followed by max for clamp operations to enable compiler recognition and optimization."
]

These statements capture the key optimization principle that ordering mathematical operations in a pattern recognizable by the compiler (like clamp operations) can lead to more efficient instruction generation. The rules are:
1. Generalizable to any CUDA kernel using clamp operations
2. Objectively verifiable through inspection of operation order
3. Deterministic in their impact on compiler optimization potential
