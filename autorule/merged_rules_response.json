  "reasoning_trace": "Alright, I need to merge a huge list of CUDA kernel optimization rules, removing duplicates and similar ones. Let's start by reading through all the rules to understand the common themes.\n\nFirst, I notice several rules about loop unrolling and pragma unroll to reduce overhead. These can be combined. Then there are multiple mentions of using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer aliasing, so those should be merged.\n\nBoundary checks and avoiding them when dimensions are multiples of tile size come up a lot. Coalesced memory access is another recurring theme, both for global and shared memory. Shared memory padding to avoid bank conflicts is mentioned in different ways.\n\nTile size adjustments for data reuse and occupancy are discussed in various contexts. Specializing for data types (like float instead of templates) and using compiler flags like -O3 and --use_fast_math appear multiple times.\n\nVectorized memory operations (float4, etc.) and efficient thread block configurations for occupancy are repeated. Reduction strategies, warp-level operations, and minimizing synchronization also come up often.\n\nI need to group these into broader categories. For example, all loop unrolling mentions can be one rule. Coalesced memory access, both global and shared, can be another. Compiler optimizations like flags and restrict qualifiers can be grouped.\n\nSome rules are about arithmetic intensity, like register blocking and sub-tiling. Others focus on memory access patterns and avoiding bank conflicts. I should ensure each unique concept is captured once without redundancy.\n\nAfter categorizing, I'll rephrase each group into a concise statement. For example, merging all instances of using __restrict__ into a single rule about enabling compiler optimizations through restrict qualifiers.\n\nI also need to check for similar rules phrased differently, like \"uses vectorized memory operations\" and \"employs vectorized loads/stores\". These should be combined.\n\nFinally, ensuring the JSON array is properly formatted with each merged rule as a string, no markdown, just the array.\n",
