  "response": "\n\nThe reasoning identifies that Kernel 2 explicitly caches input values in registers, reducing global memory accesses from two to one per element. This is captured in the first and third rules. The use of `const` qualifiers in Kernel 2 is noted as a potential compiler optimization hint, forming the second rule. These rules are objective and applicable to CUDA kernels generally.",
