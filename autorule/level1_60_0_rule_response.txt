REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel is specialized for groups=1, eliminating group-related index calculations and conditional checks.",
    "The kernel uses explicit data type (float) instead of templated types, enabling compiler optimizations for the specific type.",
    "The kernel is compiled with -O3 optimization level, enabling aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel reorders loops to prioritize input channel iterations before kernel dimensions, potentially improving memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel avoids modulo/division operations for group index calculations present in the group-supporting implementation."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the analysis of why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These statements are:

1. **Group Specialization** - Kernel 2's design for groups=1 removes group-handling logic, reducing computational overhead.
2. **Type Specialization** - Explicit use of `float` allows type-specific optimizations rather than generic template code.
3. **Compiler Optimization** - Use of `-O3` flag enables low-level performance optimizations.
4. **Loop Ordering** - Input-channel-first loop structure improves memory access patterns.
5. **Simpler Indexing** - Elimination of group-related arithmetic operations reduces instruction count.

These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
