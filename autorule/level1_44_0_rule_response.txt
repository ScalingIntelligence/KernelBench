REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses explicit loop unrolling with a specified factor (e.g., 4 or 2) to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel avoids using explicit __ldg intrinsic for read-only memory access when the compiler can automatically optimize for read-only cache usage via qualifiers like const __restrict__.",
    "The kernel applies loop unrolling to both full-window and partial-window cases to reduce branch overhead and improve memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel uses pragma unroll directives with specific unroll factors tailored to the loop structure (e.g., full-window vs. partial-window) for optimal performance."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are general and can be applied to other CUDA kernels to assess performance optimizations. The key factors include explicit loop unrolling with specified factors, avoiding redundant `__ldg` usage when compiler optimizations suffice, and applying unrolling to both primary and edge cases to minimize overhead. These rules are objective and deterministic, as they focus on identifiable code patterns rather than subjective interpretations.
