REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants general CUDA optimization rules that can be applied to various kernels.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses specific parameters (stride=1, padding=0, etc.), which simplifies calculations. This implies a rule about restricting convolution parameters to eliminate complex index computations.

Next, Kernel 2 skips boundary checks because the output dimensions are adjusted. This leads to a rule about avoiding conditional checks for input boundaries when valid padding ensures indices are within bounds.

The bias is handled outside the kernel in Kernel 2. That suggests a rule about separating bias addition from the main kernel to reduce instructions and branching.

Kernel 2's index calculations are simpler, which points to optimized memory access patterns. The example shows specific index formulas, but the general rule would be about using simpler index calculations to improve coalescing.

Kernel 2's code uses fewer variables and simpler logic, leading to lower register usage. This translates to a rule about minimizing register pressure to increase occupancy.

Specialization for fixed parameters allows compiler optimizations like loop unrolling. So, a rule about leveraging compile-time constants for optimizations.

Putting these together, the rules should be concise and applicable beyond this specific case. I need to ensure each rule is a general statement that can be objectively checked, like the presence of certain parameters or code structures.
