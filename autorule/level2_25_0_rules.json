  "The kernel uses branchless reduction operations (e.g., fminf) instead of conditional statements for value comparisons.",
  "The kernel avoids redundant computations or unused variables that may increase register pressure or instruction count.",
  "The kernel precomputes base pointers for repeated memory access patterns to simplify address calculations."
