REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to extract rule-like statements from the reasoning provided. The reasoning compared two CUDA kernels for ReLU and identified differences that might affect performance. 

First, the main difference noted was the use of 32-bit vs. 64-bit integers for the element count. The reasoning explained that using a 32-bit integer (int) in Kernel 2 allows for more efficient operations on the GPU compared to the 64-bit (int64_t) in Kernel 1. This is because GPUs handle 32-bit operations faster and with less register usage.

Another point was about the comparison operations. The 32-bit comparison in Kernel 2 (idx < size) is faster than the 64-bit comparison in Kernel 1 (index < n). The reasoning highlighted that 32-bit arithmetic is generally more efficient on GPUs.

I need to translate these observations into general, objective rules. The first rule would be about using 32-bit integers for loop bounds or indices. The second could address the efficiency of 32-bit arithmetic operations over 64-bit. 

I should check if there are other differences mentioned. The reasoning also touched on compiler flags for the host code, but concluded that the host code's impact was minimal. The main factors were the integer size and the comparison operations. 

So the rules would be:
1. Using 32-bit integer types for loop bounds or indices instead of 64-bit.
2. Preferring 32-bit arithmetic operations for better efficiency.

These are general enough to apply to various CUDA kernels and can be objectively checked by looking at the code.


ANSWER:


[
    "The kernel uses 32-bit integer types (e.g., int) for loop bounds or indices instead of 64-bit types (e.g., int64_t).",
    "The kernel avoids 64-bit arithmetic operations in performance-critical conditional checks (e.g., index comparisons)."
