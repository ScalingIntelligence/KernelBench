REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's take a look at these two CUDA kernels. The user says they both solve the same problem, but Kernel 1 is slightly faster than Kernel 2. The runtimes are 54.3 ms vs 54.6 ms. The difference is small, but there must be a reason.

First, I need to compare the two kernels line by line to spot any differences. Wait, the user provided both codes, but when I look at them, they seem almost identical. Let me check carefully.

Looking at the CUDA kernel code in both cases. Let me start with the fused_kernel_source in both. The first part is the warpReduceSum and blockReduceSum functions. Are they the same? Let me check the template parameters. In Kernel 1, the functions are declared as template<typename scalar_t>, and the parameters are float val. Wait, in the blockReduceSum, the shared memory is declared as static __shared__ float shared[32];. So regardless of the scalar_t, the shared memory is float. That's the same in both kernels.

Now, looking at the main kernel function. The parameters are the same. The loop structure for Phase 1 and Phase 2 seems identical. Let me check the indexing. The input tensor is accessed as [((b * C + c) * D + d) * H * W + h * W + w]. Same in both kernels. The HardSwish activation is applied the same way: val = val * fminf(fmaxf(val + 3.0f, 0.0f), 6.0f) / 6.0f;. Then, the normalization and scaling with weight and bias. 

Wait, in the Phase 2 loop, after normalization, they compute channel_sum and then reduce it. Both kernels have the same code here. The blockReduceSum is called, and if threadIdx.x is 0, they write to output[b * C + c]. 

Looking at the host code in fused_op_cuda. Both kernels set dim3 blocks(1, num_groups, B), threads=256, and smem=2*sizeof(float). The launch configuration is the same. The ModelNew class is also the same in both cases. 

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? The user says Kernel 2 is slower, but the code looks identical. Let me check again. Oh, wait! The user might have made a mistake in pasting the code. Let me check the code for both kernels again. 

Wait, looking at the first line of the fused_kernel in both. In Kernel 1, the template is __global__ void fused_kernel(..., and the parameters are the same. The only difference I can see is in the ModelNew class's forward function. Let me check that. 

In Kernel 1's ModelNew.forward, the line is return fused_op.fused_op_cuda(x, self.weight, bias, self.num_groups, self.eps). In Kernel 2's ModelNew.forward, it's the same. 

Wait, maybe the difference is in the CUDA kernel's code. Let me check the parameters. Oh, wait! In the fused_kernel of Kernel 1, the parameters are (input, weight, bias, output, B, C, D, H, W, G, eps). The same as Kernel 2. 

Hmm. This is confusing. The code for both kernels looks identical. How can one be faster than the other? Maybe there's a typo in the code provided by the user. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is in the way the code is launched, but the launch parameters are the same. 

Wait, looking at the block and grid dimensions. Both use dim3 blocks(1, num_groups, B). So each block is in the y and z dimensions. The number of threads is 256. But maybe the way the threads are organized affects performance. Wait, but both kernels are the same here. 

Alternatively, maybe the difference is in the order of loops. Let me check the Phase 1 loop. In both kernels, for each c in c_start to c_end, and then for each i in spatial_size. So the loop over channels is outer, and spatial elements are inner. That's the same. 

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the way the input is accessed. Let me check the index calculation again. The input is 5-dimensional: B, C, D, H, W. The index is ((b * C + c) * D + d) * H * W + h * W + w. Wait, that's (B, C, D, H, W) as dimensions. So for a 5D tensor, the index is computed as ((batch * C + channel) * D + depth) * H * W + height * W + width. That seems correct. 

But maybe there's a memory access pattern difference. For example, in CUDA, coalesced memory accesses are important. If the threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations, it's more efficient. Let's see. In the loop over i (spatial_size), each thread processes elements with a stride of blockDim.x. For example, if blockDim.x is 256, then thread 0 accesses i=0, 256, 512, etc. So for spatial elements, each thread jumps by 256 elements each iteration. But the spatial elements are stored contiguously in memory. So for D, H, W dimensions, the elements are stored in order of D, then H, then W. 

Wait, the input tensor after the conv3d layer would have a shape (B, C, D, H, W). The memory layout is in NCDHW format. So for a given batch and channel, the elements are stored in depth (D), then height (H), then width (W) order. 

When accessing the input in the kernel, for a given c and i (spatial index), the code computes d, h, w. Then, the index is ((b * C + c) * D + d) * H * W + h * W + w. Let's see: For a fixed c, varying i (spatial index) would correspond to varying d, h, w. The way i is mapped to d, h, w is i = d*(H*W) + h*W + w. So the spatial elements are stored in a contiguous block. 

But when threads access elements with a stride of blockDim.x (e.g., 256), they might be accessing non-consecutive elements. For example, if H*W is 100, then the first thread accesses d=0, h=0, w=0; the next thread (threadIdx.x=1) accesses d=0, h=0, w=1, etc. Wait, no. Wait, i is the spatial index. For i in 0 to D*H*W-1. So for each i, d = i / (H*W), h = (i % (H*W)) / W, w = i % W. 

So, for example, if H*W is 100, then i=0 is d=0, h=0, w=0; i=1 is d=0, h=0, w=1; ... i=W-1 is d=0, h=0, w=W-1; i=W is d=0, h=1, w=0, etc. So the spatial elements are stored in a way that for a given d, the elements are stored in row-major order (h, then w). 

When threads access i with a stride of blockDim.x (256), each thread processes elements that are 256 apart in the spatial index. For example, thread 0 processes i=0, 256, 512, etc. Depending on the spatial dimensions, this could lead to non-coalesced memory accesses. For instance, if the spatial size is 256, then each thread processes one element. But if the spatial size is larger, threads access elements that are spaced apart, which may not be coalesced. 

But both kernels have the same code here, so this can't explain the difference. 

Wait, maybe the difference is in the order of the loops. Let me check the Phase 1 loop in both kernels. The code is:

for (int c = c_start; c < c_end; ++c) {
    for (int i = threadIdx.x; i < spatial_size; i += blockDim.x) {
        // compute val
        thread_sum += val;
        thread_sum_sq += val * val;
    }
}

So for each channel in the group, each thread iterates over spatial elements. The order is channels first, then spatial elements. But perhaps in Kernel 1, the loop order is different? Wait, no. Both kernels have the same loop structure here. 

Wait, looking at the code again. Oh! Wait, in the first kernel's code, the line:

scalar_t val = input[((b * C + c) * D + d) * H * W + h * W + w];

But in the second kernel's code, is there a difference? Let me check. No, both have the same index calculation. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. The code for both kernels seems identical. The only possible difference is in the parameters passed to the kernel launch. Let me check the host code again. 

In both cases, the code is:

dim3 blocks(1, num_groups, B);
int threads = 256;
size_t smem = 2 * sizeof(float);

So the grid and block dimensions are the same. 

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the order of the block dimensions. For example, if the block dimensions are arranged differently, it could affect the number of blocks launched and their efficiency. But in both cases, blocks is (1, num_groups, B). So the z-dimension is B, y is num_groups, x is 1. 

But maybe the problem is that in the kernel, the blockIdx.y is used for the group, and blockIdx.z for the batch. So each block handles a group and a batch. But with blocks being (1, G, B), the total number of blocks is 1*G*B. Each block has 256 threads. 

But both kernels are the same here. 

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the shared memory usage. The smem is 2 * sizeof(float) in both cases. 

Wait, but in the kernel, they have:

extern __shared__ float smem[];
float* group_sum = smem;
float* group_sum_sq = smem + 1;

So each block allocates 2 floats in shared memory. That's correct. 

Hmm. I'm stuck. The code for both kernels looks identical. The only possible explanation is that there's a typo in the user's provided code, and the actual difference is elsewhere. But given the information, I need to find a reason. 

Wait, maybe the difference is in the order of operations. Let me check the order of applying HardSwish and the normalization. 

In both kernels, during Phase 1, they compute the val as HardSwish(input), then accumulate sum and sum_sq. Then in Phase 2, they again compute HardSwish(input), then normalize and apply weight and bias. So the HardSwish is applied twice. That's redundant. Wait, that's a problem! Because in both phases, they compute the same activation. 

Wait, in Phase 1, they compute the val as input after HardSwish for the sum and sum_sq. Then in Phase 2, they again compute the same val (HardSwish(input)) for normalization. This is redundant computation. But both kernels do this. So that's not the difference. 

But maybe in one of the kernels, they store the activated value in a buffer to reuse it in Phase 2. But looking at the code, no. Both kernels recompute the activation in both phases. 

So why is Kernel 1 faster? The only difference I can see is in the code structure. Wait, looking at the code again. Oh! Wait, in Kernel 1, the code for the fused_kernel is written with the template parameter scalar_t, but in the blockReduceSum and warpReduceSum functions, they are using float for the shared memory and reductions. 

Wait, in the blockReduceSum function, the shared memory is declared as static __shared__ float shared[32];. But the input val is a float (from the thread's computation). So regardless of the scalar_t (which could be half or float), the reductions are done in float. That's the same in both kernels. 

Wait, but maybe in one kernel, the code uses scalar_t for the val, and the other uses float. Let me check. 

In both kernels, the thread_sum and thread_sum_sq are declared as float. The input is scalar_t (the template type), but when they read the input value, they cast it to scalar_t, then compute in float. Wait, no. Let me look:

In the code:

scalar_t val = input[...];
val = val * fminf(...) / 6.0f;

Wait, scalar_t could be half (fp16), but here, the code is using fminf and fmaxf, which are float functions. So if scalar_t is half, this would involve converting to float, compute, then store back as half. But in both kernels, this is the same. 

Alternatively, maybe in one kernel, the code uses scalar_t for the intermediate val, and the other uses float. But in both, val is declared as scalar_t. Wait, no. Let me check:

In the code:

scalar_t val = input[...];
val = val * fminf(fmaxf(val + 3.0f, 0.0f), 6.0f) / 6.0f;

Wait, if scalar_t is half, then val is a half, but the operations are done in float (since fminf and fmaxf take float arguments). So this would involve converting val to float, compute, then store back as half. But this is the same in both kernels. 

Hmm. I'm really not seeing any difference between the two kernels. The user must have made a mistake in providing the code. Alternatively, maybe the difference is in the way the model is used, but the ModelNew classes are identical. 

Wait, looking at the ModelNew's forward function. In Kernel 1, the line is:

bias = self.bias if self.bias is not None else torch.zeros_like(self.weight)

But in Kernel 2, is it the same? Yes. 

Alternatively, maybe the difference is in the order of parameters when launching the kernel. For example, in one kernel, the weight and bias are passed in a different order, but no, both have the same order. 

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the AT_DISPATCH_FLOATING_TYPES macro. Let me check. Both kernels have:

AT_DISPATCH_FLOATING_TYPES(input.scalar_type(), "fused_op", ([&] {
    fused_kernel<scalar_t><<<blocks, threads, smem>>>(
        input.data_ptr<scalar_t>(),
        weight.data_ptr<scalar_t>(),
        bias.data_ptr<scalar_t>(),
        output.data_ptr<scalar_t>(),
        B, C, D, H, W,
        num_groups, eps);
}));

So the same code. 

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's no difference between the two kernels as presented. The user might have made a mistake in pasting the code, or perhaps the difference is in something not shown, like the environment or hardware during testing. But given the code provided, they are identical. 

However, the user says one is faster. So perhaps there's a subtle difference I missed. Let me check the code again. 

Wait, looking at the blockReduceSum function. In Kernel 1, the line is:

val = (threadIdx.x < (blockDim.x + 31) / 32) ? shared[lane] : 0.0f;

In Kernel 2, is it the same? Let me check. Yes. 

Wait, the blockDim.x is 256 in both cases. So (blockDim.x +31)/32 = (256+31)/32 = 287/32 = 8.968, which is 8 when integer division. Wait, no, (256 +31) is 287, divided by 32 is 8.968, but in C++ integer division, it's 8. So (blockDim.x +31)/32 is 8. So the condition is threadIdx.x < 8. 

But blockDim.x is 256, so the number of warps per block is 256 / 32 = 8. So each warp is 32 threads. So wid (threadIdx.x /32) ranges from 0 to 7. So when lane ==0, shared[wid] = val. Then, after syncthreads, the val is set to shared[lane] if threadIdx.x <8, else 0.0f. 

But this is the same in both kernels. 

Hmm. I'm really stuck. The codes look identical. The only possible explanation is that there's a typo in the user's code submission. For example, maybe in one kernel, the block dimensions are different, but in the code provided, they are the same. 

Alternatively, maybe the difference is in the number of threads per block. Let me check. Both kernels set threads=256. 

Wait, but in the kernel launch, the block dimensions are 1D (threads=256), and the grid is 3D (blocks= (1, G, B)). So each block has 256 threads in x, and 1 in y and z. 

But perhaps in one kernel, the block is launched with a different number of threads. But no, both have threads=256. 

Alternatively, maybe the shared memory allocation is different. But both have smem=2*sizeof(float). 

Wait, in the kernel, the shared memory is declared as extern __shared__ float smem[], and then group_sum and group_sum_sq are pointers to the first two elements. So each block needs 2 floats of shared memory, which is 8 bytes. Both kernels allocate that. 

I'm really not seeing any difference. The only possibility is that the user provided the same code twice, but in reality, there's a difference. For example, maybe in one kernel, the Phase 2 loop is outside the c loop, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe one kernel uses a different number of groups or other parameters. But the code for ModelNew is the same. 

Given that the codes are identical, the runtime difference might be due to random variation or measurement error. But the user says one is consistently faster. 

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the order of the parameters in the kernel launch. For example, in one kernel, the input is passed as a different data type. But both use AT_DISPATCH_FLOATING_TYPES, which handles float and double. 

Alternatively, maybe one kernel uses more registers, but that's unlikely given the same code. 

Wait, maybe the difference is in the HardSwish computation. Let me check. 

In both kernels, the line is:

val = val * fminf(fmaxf(val + 3.0f, 0.0f), 6.0f) / 6.0f;

This is the same in both. 

Alternatively, maybe one kernel uses a different epsilon value, but both set self.eps = 1e-5. 

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's no discernible difference between the two kernels based on the provided code. The user might have intended to present different codes but made a mistake. However, given the information, I can't identify a reason for the performance difference. 

But since the user insists that one is faster, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the code one more time. 

Wait, in the first kernel's fused_kernel, the template is declared as template<typename scalar_t>, and the parameters are const scalar_t* __restrict__ input, etc. But in the reduction functions, like blockReduceSum, the template parameter is scalar_t, but the function uses float for the shared memory. 

Wait, in the blockReduceSum function, the shared memory is declared as static __shared__ float shared[32];. So even if scalar_t is half, the shared memory is float. This could lead to higher precision during reductions, which might be more accurate but slower. But both kernels do this. 

Alternatively, maybe in one kernel, the reductions are done in scalar_t, but no, both use float. 

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given that the codes are identical, the only possible explanation is that the user made a mistake in the code submission. But since the user says there's a difference, I need to find a reason. 

Wait, looking at the kernel launch parameters. In both cases, blocks is (1, num_groups, B), which means the grid has 1 block in x, num_groups in y, and B in z. Each block has 256 threads. 

But perhaps in one kernel, the block dimensions are arranged differently. For example, if the block is (num_groups, B, 1), but no, the code uses blockIdx.z for batch, blockIdx.y for group. 

Alternatively, maybe the order of B and G in the blockIdx affects coalescing. For example, if blocks are arranged such that consecutive blockIdx.x values are processed together, but here, blockIdx.x is 1. 

Alternatively, the number of blocks launched could be different. For example, if in one kernel, the blocks are (B, num_groups, 1), but no, both use (1, num_groups, B). 

I'm out of ideas. The codes are identical. The only possible conclusion is that there's a mistake in the user's code submission, or the difference is due to external factors like GPU load during testing. But according to the given information, there's no code difference to analyze.


ANSWER:


The two CUDA kernels provided are **identical** in code structure and implementation. There is no discernible difference between Kernel 1 and Kernel 2 in terms of their logic, memory access patterns, parallelization strategies, or kernel launch configurations. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Code Structure**: Both kernels:
   - Use the same warp/block reduction functions (`warpReduceSum`, `blockReduceSum`).
   - Have identical loops for computing group statistics (sum and sum of squares).
   - Apply the HardSwish activation and GroupNorm identically.
   - Use the same shared memory allocation (`2 * sizeof(float)`).
   - Launch kernels with identical grid/block dimensions (`blocks = (1, num_groups, B)`, `threads = 256`).

2. **Performance**: The runtime difference (54.3 ms vs. 54.6 ms) is negligible and likely due to **external factors** such as:
   - Measurement noise (e.g., GPU thermal throttling, background processes).
   - Non-deterministic GPU scheduling.
   - Floating-point operation reordering.

### Conclusion:
There is **no algorithmic or implementation difference** between the two kernels. The observed runtime variation falls within typical GPU execution noise and does not indicate a meaningful performance optimization. Further profiling under controlled conditions would be needed to isolate true performance differences.
