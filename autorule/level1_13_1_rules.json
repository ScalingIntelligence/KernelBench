  "The kernel uses a smaller tile size to reduce shared memory usage per block, allowing more blocks to be active on each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that result in higher occupancy by fitting more blocks within the shared memory and thread count limits of the SM.",
  "The kernel optimizes global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes through appropriate thread indexing and tile dimensions.",
  "The kernel avoids shared memory bank conflicts by aligning memory accesses to different banks within a warp."
