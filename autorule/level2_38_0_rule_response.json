Each rule addresses distinct optimization strategies that contribute to performance improvements:\n\n1. **Shared Memory Caching**: Highlights the strategy of moving frequently accessed data from global to shared memory to reduce latency.\n2. **Hierarchical Synchronization**: Emphasizes optimizing synchronization by using block-level coordination for coarse work and warp-level for finer-grained operations.\n3. **Compiler Optimization**: Points to the use of compiler flags to trade precision for speed in mathematical computations.\n4. **Warp-Level Reductions**: Focuses on leveraging warp primitives to optimize parallel reduction steps.\n5. **Memory Layout Efficiency**: Addresses the importance of structuring shared memory to balance usage and access patterns.\n\nThese rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable across various CUDA kernels to guide performance optimizations.",
