REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a grid configuration that aligns with the data geometry to improve spatial locality.",
    "The kernel organizes threads to access contiguous memory locations within warps, enabling coalesced memory accesses.",
    "The kernel explicitly unrolls loops to process multiple elements per iteration, increasing instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel reduces branch divergence by simplifying comparison logic and avoiding conditional checks for tie-breaking.",
    "The kernel uses a grid layout that allows blocks to process full segments of the input data, improving cache utilization."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 performs better than Kernel 1. These statements capture general CUDA optimization principles that can be objectively evaluated:

1. Focuses on memory access patterns that enable coalescing
2. Emphasizes grid/block configuration aligned with data dimensions
3. Highlights loop unrolling strategies for ILP
4. Addresses branch divergence reduction through simplified logic
5. Mentions cache utilization through data segmentation

These rules are formulated to be applicable across various CUDA kernels beyond this specific argmax implementation.
