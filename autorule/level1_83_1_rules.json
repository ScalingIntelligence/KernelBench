  "The kernel avoids branching between vectorized and scalar memory operations, ensuring uniform execution paths within warps.",
  "The kernel uses thread block dimensions that balance workload distribution and improve memory coalescing (e.g., 16x16 instead of 32x8).",
  "The kernel replaces explicit vector load/store branches with boundary-checked loops to reduce warp divergence.",
  "The kernel employs loop-based memory access with per-element conditionals instead of branching on alignment, enabling compiler optimizations like predication.",
  "The kernel's thread block configuration optimizes occupancy by aligning with GPU resource constraints (e.g., registers, shared memory)."
