### Explanation:
1. **Avoiding vectorization pitfalls**: Vectorization (e.g., `float4`) can hurt performance if unaligned or if edge-case handling causes warp divergence.
2. **1D execution configuration**: Simpler grid/block layouts improve GPU scheduler efficiency and reduce indexing overhead.
3. **Shared memory trade-offs**: Tiling is counterproductive for small operations (e.g., 2x2 pooling) due to synchronization and data-copy costs.
4. **Branch-free design**: Using intrinsics like `fminf` avoids warp divergence from conditionals (e.g., ternary operators).
5. **Block size selection**: 256-thread blocks balance occupancy and register pressure better than larger (512) or multidimensional blocks.
6. **Coalesced global memory**: Direct, contiguous global memory access outperforms shared memory for small, predictable workloads.
