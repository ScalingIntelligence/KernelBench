ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses shared memory to cache weights, reducing global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel employs 2D thread blocks and output tiling to enable memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel unrolls loops with fixed bounds using pragma directives to reduce overhead.",
    "The kernel combines batch and output channel dimensions in grid organization for increased parallelism.",
    "The kernel utilizes fixed kernel dimensions to enable compile-time optimizations.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to avoid pointer aliasing and improve compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel employs thread block sizes and shared memory usage that improve GPU occupancy."
]

These statements are:
1. Objective - Can be verified by examining memory types (shared/global) and compiler directives
2. Deterministic - Presence of specific CUDA features like restrict qualifiers or loop unrolling pragmas can be definitively checked
3. Generalizable - Applicable to various CUDA kernels beyond just convolution operations
4. Actionable - Provide clear optimization strategies for GPU programmers

Each rule corresponds to a distinct optimization technique that can be independently analyzed and applied to other kernels.
