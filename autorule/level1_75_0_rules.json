  "The kernel uses a grid organization that aligns thread blocks with output dimensions to enable coalesced memory writes.",
  "The kernel reduces index calculation overhead by leveraging grid dimensions directly for coordinate derivation.",
  "The kernel organizes threads to minimize divergent branches within warps by grouping similar computations together.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns for spatial locality, improving cache utilization."
