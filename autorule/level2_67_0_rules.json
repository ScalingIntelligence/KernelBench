  "The kernel avoids division and modulus operations in index calculations by using linear offsets.",
  "The kernel includes a secondary loop to process remaining elements when the total number of elements is not a multiple of the vector size.",
  "The kernel uses contiguous memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory reads.",
  "The kernel is compiled with optimization flags (-O3) enabling aggressive compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel is compiled with fast math flags (-use_fast_math) to use approximate but faster mathematical operations.",
  "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous before processing to guarantee optimal memory layout."
