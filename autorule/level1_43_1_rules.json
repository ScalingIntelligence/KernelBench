  "The kernel precomputes loop-invariant start positions outside of nested loops to reduce redundant calculations.",
  "The kernel uses the linear thread index directly for output tensor indexing instead of recalculating equivalent offsets from higher-dimensional indices.",
  "The kernel unravels linear indices into spatial dimensions using sequential division and modulus operations rather than deeply nested calculations."
