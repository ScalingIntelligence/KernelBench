  "response": "\n\nThe answer identifies three key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. These rules focus on FMA utilization, compiler optimization alignment, and arithmetic operation efficiency. Each rule is generalizable to CUDA kernels and can be objectively verified by inspecting code structure, compiler outputs (e.g., PTX), or profiling instruction counts. The rules avoid referencing specific numerical values (e.g., `1/6` or `0.5`) to maintain generality.",
