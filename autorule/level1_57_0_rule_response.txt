REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a 3D grid with 2D thread blocks to better match the output tensor structure (NCHW), keeping threads in a warp focused on adjacent spatial positions.",
    "The kernel orders loops to prioritize sequential access to weight tensor elements (c_in first, then kh and kw), enabling coalesced memory reads.",
    "The kernel uses 2D thread blocks (e.g., 16x16) to process nearby output pixels, improving input reuse through L1 cache for overlapping kernel positions.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory access patterns in weight tensor reads by maintaining sequential access through loop ordering."
