ANSWER:


The provided JSON array captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each rule addresses a distinct optimization strategy employed in Kernel 2 to outperform Kernel 1:

1. **Avoiding Loop Unrolling**: Kernel 2 avoids loop unrolling in the depthwise convolution, reducing register pressure and improving thread occupancy. This contrasts with Kernel 1, where unrolling increased register usage, limiting parallelism.

2. **Thread Grouping by Output Channels**: In the pointwise convolution, Kernel 2 groups threads by output channels first. This enables broadcast memory access patterns for weight values, reducing redundant global memory transactions.

3. **Coalesced Memory Access**: Kernel 2's thread block organization ensures consecutive threads access spatially adjacent elements within the same output channel (NCHW layout), enabling coalesced writes to global memory.

These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to general CUDA kernel optimization scenarios.
