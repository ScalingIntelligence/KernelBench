  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules highlight deterministic optimizations in Kernel 2 that objectively differentiate it from Kernel 1, such as precomputing loop invariants, leveraging linear indexing, and using sequential index unraveling. Each rule is generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization scenarios.",
