ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop pattern to enable coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel avoids loop unrolling to reduce register pressure and improve occupancy.",
    "The kernel uses a warp-aware shared memory reduction with fixed strides instead of transitioning to warp shuffles.",
    "The kernel structures memory access to minimize scattered accesses by processing contiguous windows."
]

These rules capture the key optimization differences in:
1. Memory access patterns (coalescing vs scattered)
2. Loop optimization tradeoffs
3. Reduction strategy implementation
4. Memory locality prioritization

Each statement is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
