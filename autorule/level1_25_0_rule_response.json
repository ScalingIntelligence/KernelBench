  "response": "\n\nThe answer identifies two key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. The first rule addresses avoiding Python-level attribute lookups by storing the CUDA function reference upfront. The second rule generalizes this to minimizing Python-side overhead through pre-binding. Both rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimizations in PyTorch extensions.",
