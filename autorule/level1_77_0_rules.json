  "The kernel checks validity conditions (modulo and bounds) for each dimension loop (e.g., kd) before proceeding to inner loops (e.g., kh, kw), allowing early termination of inner iterations when checks fail.",
  "The kernel is compiled with the -O3 optimization flag to enable aggressive compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and instruction reordering.",
  "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous in memory to improve memory access patterns and coalescing.",
  "The kernel initializes the accumulation variable with bias (if present) outside the main computation loop to avoid conditional checks during accumulation."
