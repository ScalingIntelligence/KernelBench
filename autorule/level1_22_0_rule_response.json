  "response": "\n\nThe reasoning identifies that Kernel 1 uses `-O3` compiler optimizations and a block size of 256 (a power of two). These are generalizable, objective rules about compiler flags and thread block sizing. The power-of-two block size aligns with CUDA best practices for warp utilization, while explicit `-O3` usage is a measurable optimization choice.",
