  "The kernel uses smaller tile sizes to reduce shared memory usage per block, allowing higher occupancy on streaming multiprocessors (SMs).",
  "The kernel avoids shared memory configurations that exceed hardware limits per block, ensuring more concurrent blocks can be scheduled on an SM.",
  "The kernel uses thread block dimensions that balance parallelism and shared memory usage to maximize occupancy.",
  "The kernel structures grid dimensions to prioritize spatial locality for batched operations (e.g., batch index in the z-dimension)."
