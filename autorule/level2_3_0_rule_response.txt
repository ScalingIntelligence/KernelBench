REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel fuses multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce kernel launch overhead.",
    "The kernel organizes thread blocks to process contiguous memory dimensions, enabling coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel uses shared memory and block-level parallel reductions for efficient computation of statistics.",
    "The kernel employs a thread block organization that matches the tensor structure to simplify indexing and improve memory locality.",
    "The kernel avoids complex index calculations by aligning thread and block dimensions with data dimensions.",
    "The kernel is specialized for specific tensor dimensions to enable tailored optimizations."

ANSWER:


The JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These statements focus on generalizable CUDA optimization strategies such as operation fusion, memory access patterns, efficient reductions, thread organization, and specialization. Each rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to various CUDA kernels, aligning with the criteria outlined in the problem statement.
