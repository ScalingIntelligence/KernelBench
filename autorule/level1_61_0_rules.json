  "The kernel assigns one thread per output element to maximize parallelism.",
  "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 256 threads) to achieve higher GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel employs a 1D grid configuration to ensure efficient coverage of output elements and minimize wasted threads.",
  "The kernel avoids nested loops over output channels within individual threads to reduce per-thread workload and control flow complexity.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns to enable coalesced global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel minimizes divergent branching within warps by structuring threads to follow similar code paths for adjacent outputs."
