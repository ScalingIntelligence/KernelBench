Each entry represents a distinct optimization strategy applicable to CUDA kernels:\n\n1. **Warp-level reductions** replace shared memory operations for efficiency\n2. **Precomputed reciprocals** optimize division-heavy calculations\n3. **Loop unrolling** reduces control flow overhead\n4. **Restrict qualifiers** enable better compiler optimizations\n5. **Sequential memory patterns** improve coalescing\n6. **Fast math** accelerates transcendental operations\n7. **Atomic operation avoidance** through output partitioning\n8. **Warp-aligned processing** matches hardware characteristics\n\nThese rules are objectively verifiable through code inspection and compiler flags, and can be generally applied to optimize other CUDA kernels.",
