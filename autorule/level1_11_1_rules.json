  "The kernel uses a vendor-optimized library (e.g., cuBLAS) for architecture-specific optimizations.",
  "The kernel employs optimal tiling strategies to cache data in shared memory, reducing global memory access.",
  "The kernel leverages specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) for accelerated matrix operations when available.",
  "The kernel ensures coalesced global memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.",
  "The kernel avoids conditional branches within critical loops to prevent warp divergence.",
  "The kernel uses grid and block configurations that maximize SM occupancy and thread utilization.",
  "The kernel transforms higher-dimensional tensor operations into optimized 2D matrix operations for compatibility with highly-tuned library functions.",
  "The kernel minimizes residual handling through dimension padding or specialized edge-case kernels to reduce control flow overhead."
