  "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations, enabling memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel organizes weight accesses such that threads within the same warp access contiguous weight elements, improving cache utilization.",
  "The kernel employs a linear thread indexing strategy to simplify thread scheduling and increase GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel avoids multi-dimensional grid configurations that may lead to non-contiguous memory accesses and underutilization of GPU resources."
