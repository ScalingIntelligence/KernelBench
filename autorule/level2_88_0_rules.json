  "The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations.",
  "The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
  "The kernel maintains intermediate results in registers or shared memory to avoid global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel is compiled with fast math compiler flags to enable approximate mathematical optimizations.",
  "The kernel employs a grid configuration that maximizes GPU occupancy through a higher number of smaller thread blocks."
