REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively verifiable.

First, the main points from the reasoning are:

1. **Kernel Fusion**: Kernel 1 combines multiple operations (GroupNorm, Swish, Multiply, Swish) into a single kernel, reducing the number of kernel launches. This is a clear rule about operator fusion.

2. **Shared Memory for Reductions**: The use of shared memory in GroupNorm's mean and variance calculations. This points to using shared memory tiling for reductions, which is a known optimization.

3. **Memory Locality**: Keeping intermediate results in registers or shared memory instead of global memory. This relates to minimizing global memory access by leveraging faster memory types.

4. **Block/Grid Configuration**: Kernel 1 uses a 2D grid with smaller thread blocks (32 threads), which can improve occupancy. The example given mentions multiples of warp size, so this fits a general rule about thread block sizes.

5. **Compiler Flags**: Using flags like --use_fast_math and -O3. These are specific optimizations that can be applied generally.

6. **Avoiding Intermediate Global Memory Transactions**: By fusing operations, Kernel 1 skips writing and reading from global memory between steps. This is a form of optimizing memory access patterns.

Now, translating these into rule-like statements:

- **Fusion of multiple operations into a single kernel** is covered in the examples, so similar phrasing.
- **Using shared memory for parallel reductions** is a specific case of shared memory tiling.
- **Maintaining intermediate results in registers or shared memory** is about memory locality.
- **Thread block sizes set to match features per group (e.g., 32)** relates to warp size multiples if 32 is the warp size. But the reasoning mentions 32 threads per block, which is exactly the warp size. So this can be a rule about thread block sizes being multiples of warp size.
- **Compiler optimizations like --use_fast_math and -O3** are specific flags that can be generalized as using fast math compilation flags.
- **Grid configuration with 2D structure for higher parallelism** could be a rule about grid dimensions optimizing occupancy.

But need to ensure the rules are objective and deterministic. For example, "using shared memory for reductions" is a clear rule. Similarly, "compiling with fast math flags" is a specific action.

So the extracted rules would be:

1. The kernel fuses multiple operations (e.g., group normalization, activation functions) into a single kernel launch.
2. The kernel uses shared memory for parallel reductions to compute statistics (e.g., mean, variance).
3. The kernel maintains intermediate results in registers or shared memory to minimize global memory access.
4. The kernel uses thread block sizes that match the warp size (32 threads) to improve occupancy.
5. The kernel is compiled with fast math compiler flags (e.g., --use_fast_math) to enable approximate mathematical optimizations.
6. The kernel employs a 2D grid configuration to increase parallelism and better utilize GPU resources.

Each of these can be checked objectively. For example, checking if the kernel combines multiple operations, uses shared memory for reductions, block size is 32, compiler flags include --use_fast_math, etc.
