REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization flags (e.g., -O2) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel benefits from compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling, instruction reordering, and improved register allocation due to explicit optimization flags.",
    "The kernel reduces redundant calculations and optimizes memory access patterns through compiler-driven optimizations enabled by higher optimization levels."
