  "The kernel uses memory access patterns that group consecutive thread accesses to contiguous memory addresses for better coalescing.",
  "The kernel orders loops to prioritize reuse of loaded values in registers across inner loop iterations.",
  "The kernel employs const qualifiers on loop variables to enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and register allocation.",
  "The kernel structures index calculations to match the tensor layout (e.g., NCHW) for sequential memory access patterns."
