REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (e.g., 512 threads per block) to improve occupancy on Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).",
    "The kernel minimizes register usage per thread by processing fewer elements per thread, allowing higher occupancy.",
    "The kernel avoids intra-warp branching by using simpler control flow (e.g., no conditional paths for vectorized vs. scalar processing).",
    "The kernel uses a grid configuration that directly maps threads to elements without requiring complex thread-to-element indexing logic.",
    "The kernel employs contiguous memory access patterns that are efficiently handled by modern GPUs without explicit vectorization (e.g., float4)."

Here is the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

These rules capture the key differences in block size, register usage, control flow, grid configuration, and memory access patterns that influenced the performance difference between the two kernels.
