  "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop pattern to improve GPU utilization and handle cases where the total number of elements exceeds the grid size.",
  "The kernel leverages the read-only data cache via the __ldg() intrinsic for frequently accessed data like weights and inputs.",
  "The kernel unrolls inner loops using pragma directives (e.g., #pragma unroll) to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel employs __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable compiler optimizations by guaranteeing no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel structures weight tensor memory layout to enable sequential access patterns during critical loops (e.g., grouping dimensions to promote coalesced access).",
  "The kernel reorganizes loop order and indexing to ensure contiguous memory access for adjacent threads, particularly in inner loops over input/output channels.",
  "The kernel aligns tensor dimensions and access strides with thread execution patterns to minimize non-coalesced global memory accesses."
