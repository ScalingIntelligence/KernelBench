REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's try to figure out why Kernel 2 is faster than Kernel 1. Both are doing batched matrix multiplication, but there's a 1 ms difference. Let me look at the code differences.

First, the tile sizes. Kernel 1 uses a TILE_SIZE of 32, while Kernel 2 uses 16. Tile size can affect how well the threads are utilized and how much data is reused from shared memory. A smaller tile might lead to more tiles being processed, but each tile is smaller, which could lead to better occupancy if the number of threads per block is lower. Wait, the threads per block in Kernel 1 are 32x32, which is 1024 threads per block. But CUDA has a maximum of 1024 threads per block, so that's the maximum. However, using 32x32 tiles might lead to more shared memory usage per block. Let me check the shared memory allocation.

In Kernel 1, each block uses two shared memory arrays of size TILE_SIZE x TILE_SIZE. For TILE_SIZE=32, each array is 32x32 floats, so 32*32*4 = 4096 bytes per array. Two arrays would be 8192 bytes per block. CUDA's shared memory per block varies by GPU, but let's say it's 48KB. Then each block uses 8KB, so you can have 6 blocks per SM. But if the tile is 16x16, like in Kernel 2, each shared memory array is 16x16*4=1024 bytes. Two arrays would be 2048 bytes per block. That allows more blocks to be active on an SM, increasing occupancy. Higher occupancy can hide memory latency better. So maybe Kernel 2's smaller tile size allows more blocks to run concurrently, leading to better performance.

Another thing is the loop unrolling. Kernel 1 uses #pragma unroll on the inner loop over TILE_SIZE. Kernel 2 doesn't have that. Wait, but Kernel 2's TILE_SIZE is 16, so the loop is shorter. Maybe the compiler automatically unrolls it, or maybe the unroll in Kernel 1 isn't as effective when TILE_SIZE is 32. Unrolling can reduce loop overhead, but if the loop is longer, it might increase register pressure. If Kernel 1's loop is unrolled 32 times, that's a lot more instructions, which might cause more register usage, leading to lower occupancy. Kernel 2's loop is 16 iterations, which is easier to unroll without using too many registers. So maybe Kernel 2 has better register usage, allowing more threads to be active.

Looking at the block and grid dimensions. Kernel 1's blocks are organized as (N, tileM, tileL), with each block handling a tile of M and L. The grid is 3D. Kernel 2's blocks are organized as (L_tiles, M_tiles, N), so the batch is in the z-dimension. The way blocks are arranged can affect how the work is distributed across SMs. Maybe Kernel 2's arrangement allows for better coalescing of global memory accesses. Let me check the memory access patterns.

In Kernel 1, when loading A and B tiles, they use __ldg (LDG) to load through the read-only cache. Kernel 2 doesn't use __ldg, but maybe the data is already in the cache. Wait, in Kernel 1, A is a 3D tensor, and B is 2D. For each batch, A is accessed as batch * M*K + a_row*K + a_col. B is accessed as b_row * L + b_col. In Kernel 2, when loading B, it's B[bRow * L + bCol]. So the access pattern for B in Kernel 1 is row-major, same as Kernel 2. But Kernel 1 uses __ldg which might help with caching. However, maybe the tile size being 32 in Kernel 1 leads to more bank conflicts in shared memory. Because with 32x32 tiles, when threads access rows and columns, the shared memory is organized in banks (usually 32 banks). If multiple threads access the same bank, it causes conflicts. For example, in the inner loop when accessing As[thread_row][k], if thread_row varies and k is the same, then for a 32x32 tile, each row is 32 elements, so consecutive threads (threadIdx.x) would access the same bank. Wait, in shared memory, the elements are stored in row-major. So for As[thread_row][k], if thread_row is the y dimension (threadIdx.y), and k is the loop variable, then when threads in a warp access As[thread_row][k], each thread in the warp (with consecutive threadIdx.x) would have thread_row fixed (since threadIdx.y is fixed for a warp in a 2D block?), or maybe not. Wait, the thread layout in the block: Kernel 1 uses dim3 threads(TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE), so threadIdx.x is the column (TILE_SIZE=32), threadIdx.y is the row. So a warp is 32 threads. In a 32x32 block, each warp would consist of threads where threadIdx.y is fixed for a group of 32 threads. Wait, no. The way threads are grouped into warps is in row-major order. So for a block of 32x32 threads, the first warp is threadIdx.x 0-31 and threadIdx.y 0. Then the next warp is threadIdx.x 0-31, threadIdx.y 1, etc. So each warp has consecutive threadIdx.x in the same row. 

When accessing As[thread_row][k], which is As[y][x], in shared memory. For a 32x32 tile, each row in As is 32 elements. So when k is looped over, each thread in the warp (same threadIdx.y, varying threadIdx.x) would access As[y][k], where k is the same for all threads in the loop iteration. Wait, no. Wait, in the inner loop of the matrix multiply, each thread computes sum += As[thread_row][k] * Bs[k][thread_col]. So for thread_row and thread_col (which are threadIdx.y and threadIdx.x), each thread is multiplying As's row (thread_row) and column k, with Bs's row k and column thread_col. 

In the case of Kernel 1, TILE_SIZE=32. So when the threads in a warp (same threadIdx.y, varying threadIdx.x) access As[thread_row][k], for a fixed k, all threads in the warp are accessing the same column (k) of As. Since As is stored in row-major, the elements As[thread_row][k] for different thread_row are in different rows, but same column. In shared memory, consecutive rows are stored with a stride of TILE_SIZE. So for a 32x32 tile, each row is 32 elements. So the address for As[thread_row][k] is (thread_row * 32 + k) * 4 bytes. Since the shared memory has 32 banks, each bank is 4 bytes. So for a 32x32 tile, each column is 32 elements, so when k is fixed, thread_row varies, each element As[thread_row][k] is spaced 32 * 4 = 128 bytes apart. Since 128 bytes is 32 banks * 4 bytes, so each access would be to the same bank. That would cause a 32-way bank conflict, which is terrible. Because all threads in the warp are accessing the same bank, leading to serialization. That's a big problem. 

In contrast, Kernel 2 uses TILE_SIZE=16. So As is 16x16. For As[threadIdx.y][k], when k is fixed, each thread in the warp (assuming threadIdx.x varies) would have threadIdx.y fixed. Wait, in Kernel 2, the threads are arranged as TILE_SIZE=16 in both x and y. So each block has 16x16=256 threads. The warps are 32 threads, so each warp is 2 consecutive rows (since 16 threads per row, two rows make 32 threads). So when accessing As[threadIdx.y][k], for a fixed k, each thread in the warp would have threadIdx.y varying (since two rows per warp). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For a 16x16 block, thread IDs are ordered with x first. So thread 0 is (0,0), thread 1 (1,0), ..., thread 15 (15,0), thread 16 (0,1), etc. So a warp (32 threads) would consist of two rows: threads 0-15 (y=0) and 16-31 (y=1). So in a warp, threadIdx.y alternates between 0 and 1. So when accessing As[threadIdx.y][k], for a fixed k, the threads in the warp would access two different rows in As. For a 16x16 tile, each row is 16 elements. So the address for As[threadIdx.y][k] is (threadIdx.y * 16 + k) * 4. For 16 elements per row, the stride between rows is 16 elements. So for two different threadIdx.y values (0 and 1), the addresses would be (0*16 +k) and (1*16 +k). The difference between these addresses is 16 elements *4 bytes = 64 bytes. Since the shared memory has 32 banks (each 4 bytes), 64 bytes is 16 banks apart. So each thread in the warp accesses a different bank, leading to no bank conflicts. That's much better. 

So in Kernel 1, the 32x32 tile leads to bank conflicts in shared memory accesses, especially when reading As and Bs during the matrix multiplication step. Each access to As[thread_row][k] (for fixed k) would have all threads in the warp accessing the same bank, causing 32-way bank conflicts. Similarly for Bs[k][thread_col], when k is fixed and thread_col varies. For Bs, which is stored as [TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE], accessing Bs[k][thread_col] would be column-wise. For TILE_SIZE=32, each thread in the warp (same threadIdx.y, varying threadIdx.x) would access Bs[k][thread_col], which is in the same row (k) but different columns. Since Bs is stored in row-major, each element in the row is consecutive. So for a row k, the elements Bs[k][thread_col] are in consecutive addresses. So for thread_col from 0 to 31, each thread accesses consecutive elements. Since each bank is 4 bytes, consecutive elements are in consecutive banks. So for 32 threads accessing 32 consecutive elements, each in a different bank. That's perfect, no bank conflicts. But for As, the access is row-wise but with fixed k, leading to bank conflicts. 

In Kernel 2, with TILE_SIZE=16, the As and Bs accesses are better. For As[threadIdx.y][k], with threadIdx.y varying between 0 and 1 in a warp (since two rows per warp), and k fixed, each thread accesses a different row. The addresses are spaced 16 elements apart, which is 64 bytes, leading to 16 banks apart (since 64 /4 =16). So each thread in the warp accesses a different bank, no conflicts. Similarly, when accessing Bs[k][threadIdx.x], since Bs is stored as [TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE], and threadIdx.x varies from 0 to 15 (for the first half of the warp) and then 0-15 again for the next half. For each k, Bs[k][threadIdx.x] would be in the same row, consecutive columns. So for 16 threads in a row, accessing 16 consecutive elements (since TILE_SIZE=16), each in a different bank. Then the next 16 threads (from the next row) would access the same row, but since TILE_SIZE is 16, maybe they are accessing the same elements? Wait, no. Wait, in Kernel 2, the threads are 16x16, so each thread has threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y from 0 to 15. When the loop runs over k, each thread in the warp (32 threads) would have threadIdx.x from 0-15 and threadIdx.y from 0-1. So when accessing Bs[k][threadIdx.x], for each k, the first 16 threads (threadIdx.y=0) access Bs[k][0-15], and the next 16 (threadIdx.y=1) also access Bs[k][0-15]. Wait, that's possible. But since Bs is a shared memory tile loaded by the threads, each thread in the block is responsible for loading one element of As and Bs. So during the tile loading phase, each thread in the block (16x16) loads one element of As and Bs. Then, during the computation, each thread uses the entire tile. So when accessing Bs[k][threadIdx.x], for a warp that's split into two rows (threadIdx.y 0 and 1), each thread in the warp would access Bs[k][threadIdx.x], which for threadIdx.x 0-15 and threadIdx.y 0-1. So for each k, the threads access Bs[k][0-15] for both threadIdx.y=0 and 1. But since Bs is a 16x16 tile, each row k has 16 elements. So when threadIdx.x is 0-15, and threadIdx.y is 0, they access Bs[k][0-15]. For threadIdx.y=1, same threadIdx.x, they also access Bs[k][0-15], but that's the same elements. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the code. Wait, in Kernel 2, during the B tile loading:

        // Load B tile
        int bRow = tiledK + threadIdx.y;
        int bCol = col;
        if (bRow < K && bCol < L) {
            Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[bRow * L + bCol];
        } else {
            Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0f;
        }

So threadIdx.y and threadIdx.x are used to load Bs. For each thread in the block (threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y from 0 to 15), they load Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[bRow][bCol]. So Bs is filled such that threadIdx.y is the row in Bs, and threadIdx.x is the column. So Bs is a 16x16 matrix where each thread loads one element. Then, during the computation, when accessing Bs[k][threadIdx.x], for a particular k, each thread in the warp (threadIdx.x 0-15, threadIdx.y 0-1) would access Bs[k][threadIdx.x]. Since Bs is stored in row-major, Bs[k][threadIdx.x] for threadIdx.x 0-15 would be 16 consecutive elements in row k of Bs. For the first 16 threads in the warp (threadIdx.y=0), they access Bs[k][0-15], which are consecutive, no bank conflicts. The next 16 threads (threadIdx.y=1) also access Bs[k][0-15], which are the same elements. Wait, that would cause bank conflicts because multiple threads are accessing the same elements. But wait, no. Each thread in the warp is part of the same block, and during the computation phase, all threads in the block are using the same Bs tile. So when threadIdx.y=0 and threadIdx.x=0, they access Bs[k][0], and threadIdx.y=1, threadIdx.x=0 would also access Bs[k][0]. But in that case, multiple threads in the warp are accessing the same address. That would cause a broadcast, which is efficient if all threads read the same address. But in this case, during the computation loop, each thread is multiplying As[threadIdx.y][k] by Bs[k][threadIdx.x]. So for threadIdx.y=0 and threadIdx.x=0, they use Bs[k][0]. For threadIdx.y=0 and threadIdx.x=1, Bs[k][1], etc. So in the inner loop, each thread in the warp (for Kernel 2) is accessing Bs[k][threadIdx.x], which for threadIdx.x 0-15 (since TILE_SIZE=16) would be 16 unique elements. But the warp has 32 threads. Wait, no. The block is 16x16 threads, so each thread has threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y from 0 to 15. So in a warp of 32 threads, the first 16 threads have threadIdx.y=0 and threadIdx.x 0-15, and the next 16 have threadIdx.y=1 and threadIdx.x 0-15. So when accessing Bs[k][threadIdx.x], for the first 16 threads (threadIdx.x 0-15), they access Bs[k][0-15]. For the next 16 threads (threadIdx.x 0-15 again), they also access Bs[k][0-15]. So each of the 32 threads in the warp is accessing the same 16 elements (Bs[k][0-15]) but with threadIdx.x ranging from 0-15 twice. That would mean that each element in Bs[k][0-15] is accessed by two threads in the warp. This would cause bank conflicts because each element is in a specific bank, and two threads are accessing the same bank. For example, Bs[k][0] is in bank 0, and two threads (thread 0 and thread 16) are accessing it. This would cause a 2-way bank conflict. But since the warp is 32 threads, and each element is accessed twice, this would lead to 2-way bank conflicts for each access. However, in recent GPUs, the shared memory can broadcast a value to multiple threads in a warp if they read the same address, which avoids bank conflicts. So if multiple threads read the same address, it's handled efficiently. So in this case, even though two threads access the same element, the GPU can broadcast the value without bank conflicts. Therefore, the Bs accesses in Kernel 2 may not have bank conflicts, while the As accesses in Kernel 1 do.

So the main difference is that Kernel 1's larger tile size leads to more bank conflicts in shared memory accesses, especially in the As matrix, which causes serialization and reduces performance. Kernel 2's smaller tile size reduces bank conflicts, allowing for better shared memory access patterns and higher occupancy, leading to faster execution.

Another factor is the loop unrolling. Kernel 1 uses #pragma unroll on the inner loop, which can increase instruction count and register usage. If the loop is unrolled 32 times (TILE_SIZE=32), that's a lot of instructions, which might lead to higher register pressure. Higher register usage can reduce the number of threads that can be active on an SM (occupancy), leading to lower performance. Kernel 2's TILE_SIZE=16 means the loop is shorter, and even if unrolled, uses fewer instructions, leading to lower register pressure and better occupancy.

Additionally, the block dimensions and grid organization might affect memory coalescing. In Kernel 1, the batch is in blockIdx.x, while in Kernel 2, the batch is in blockIdx.z. The order of block dimensions can affect how threads access global memory. For example, in Kernel 1, when writing to C, the batch is the first dimension, so consecutive threads in a block (same batch) write to consecutive memory locations if their row and column are consecutive. In Kernel 2, the batch is in blockIdx.z, so each block handles a different batch. However, the exact impact of this on coalescing depends on how the threads are arranged. Both kernels seem to write to C in a coalesced manner as they check row and column boundaries and write in a contiguous way. So this might not be a major factor.

Another point is the use of __ldg in Kernel 1. The __ldg function is used to load data through the read-only cache, which can improve performance for data that is read-only. However, in Kernel 2, the code doesn't use __ldg. But if the data is already in the cache, or if the access pattern is more efficient, the lack of __ldg might not hurt. However, Kernel 1's use of __ldg might not be enough to offset the other inefficiencies like bank conflicts and lower occupancy.

In summary, the key reasons Kernel 2 is faster are:

1. Smaller tile size (16x16) leading to fewer bank conflicts in shared memory accesses, especially in the As matrix.
2. Better occupancy due to smaller tile size, allowing more blocks to be active on an SM.
3. Lower register pressure from shorter loops (TILE_SIZE=16) and possibly less unrolling, allowing more threads to be active.


ANSWER:


The performance difference between the two kernels stems from their tile sizes and shared memory access patterns:

1. **Tile Size & Bank Conflicts**:
   - Kernel 1 uses a 32x32 tile, causing severe 32-way bank conflicts in shared memory during `As` accesses. Each warp's threads access the same bank when reading rows of `As`, serializing memory operations.
   - Kernel 2's 16x16 tile eliminates these conflicts. The smaller tile ensures shared memory accesses are spread across different banks, enabling parallel access.

2. **Occupancy**:
   - Kernel 1's larger tile uses more shared memory (8KB/block vs 2KB/block), limiting concurrent blocks per SM. Its 1024 threads/block also max out thread count, reducing scheduling flexibility.
   - Kernel 2's smaller tile and 256 threads/block allow more blocks to run concurrently, improving occupancy and latency hiding.

3. **Loop Unrolling & Register Pressure**:
   - Kernel 1 unrolls a 32-iteration loop, increasing register usage and reducing occupancy.
   - Kernel 2's 16-iteration loop is inherently shorter, requiring fewer registers even if unrolled, preserving occupancy.

4. **Coalesced Writes**:
   Both kernels write coalesced outputs, but Kernel 2's efficient shared memory accesses allow better overlap of computation and memory operations.

**Conclusion**: Kernel 2's smaller tile size optimizes shared memory access patterns and occupancy, outweighing Kernel 1's read-only cache optimizations (`__ldg`).
