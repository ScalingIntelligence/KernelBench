  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are: \n\n1. **Input Channel Inner Loops**: Kernel 1's loop ordering (input channels as inner loops) enables contiguous memory access for input tensors, which is critical for coalescing.  \n2. **Compiler Optimization Flags**: Explicit use of `-O3` in Kernel 1 enables deeper compiler optimizations compared to default settings.  \n3. **Spatial Index Precomputation**: Precomputing spatial indices reduces redundant calculations and register pressure.  \n4. **Input Access Prioritization**: Kernel 1 prioritizes input tensor access patterns (via loop order) over weight tensor locality, as input size dominates performance.  \n\nThese rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.",
