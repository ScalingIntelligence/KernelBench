REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions to combine multiplication and addition into a single operation.",
    "The kernel structures arithmetic operations to match compiler optimizations for FMA instruction generation.",
    "The kernel minimizes the number of arithmetic operations by leveraging algebraic equivalence for computational efficiency."

ANSWER:


The answer identifies three key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. These rules focus on FMA utilization, compiler optimization alignment, and arithmetic operation efficiency. Each rule is generalizable to CUDA kernels and can be objectively verified by inspecting code structure, compiler outputs (e.g., PTX), or profiling instruction counts. The rules avoid referencing specific numerical values (e.g., `1/6` or `0.5`) to maintain generality.
