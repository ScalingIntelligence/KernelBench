  "The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.",
  "The kernel transposes weight matrices to enable coalesced global memory reads.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that align with GPU warp/wavefront execution patterns (e.g., 32x32).",
  "The kernel implements parallel reductions using warp-shuffle instructions and shared memory.",
  "The kernel reuses loaded input data through shared memory across multiple computations.",
  "The kernel employs block-level parallelism by assigning one block per data sample with multiple threads.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory operations.",
  "The kernel uses thread block configurations that maximize warp utilization (e.g., 256 threads per block)."
