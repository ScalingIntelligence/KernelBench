  "The kernel uses log1pf instead of logf(1.0f + expf(val)) to reduce the number of floating-point operations.",
  "The kernel leverages CUDA's optimized intrinsic functions (e.g., log1pf) for improved numerical precision and performance.",
  "The kernel minimizes computational steps by combining operations (e.g., log1p(expf(val))) to enhance instruction throughput."
