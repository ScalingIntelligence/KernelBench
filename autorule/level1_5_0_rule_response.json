  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. These statements are objective and can be applied to evaluate other CUDA kernels:\n\n1. **Contiguous Memory Enforcement**  \n   The first rule highlights the importance of ensuring contiguous memory layouts for input tensors to enable coalesced memory access, a critical optimization for memory-bound operations.\n\n2. **Thread Block Size Optimization**  \n   The second rule emphasizes using larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads/block) to improve GPU occupancy and latency hiding, which is particularly relevant for memory-bound kernels.\n\n3. **Strided Access Avoidance**  \n   The third rule explicitly calls out avoiding strided memory accesses through contiguity enforcement, a key determinant of memory throughput efficiency.\n\nThese rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and can be objectively verified by inspecting memory management practices (e.g., `contiguous()` calls) and kernel launch configurations (block size choices).",
