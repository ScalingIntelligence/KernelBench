  "The kernel fuses multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce kernel launch overhead.",
  "The kernel organizes thread blocks to process contiguous memory dimensions, enabling coalesced memory access.",
  "The kernel uses shared memory and block-level parallel reductions for efficient computation of statistics.",
  "The kernel employs a thread block organization that matches the tensor structure to simplify indexing and improve memory locality.",
  "The kernel avoids complex index calculations by aligning thread and block dimensions with data dimensions.",
  "The kernel is specialized for specific tensor dimensions to enable tailored optimizations."
