  "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop to ensure coalesced memory access across consecutive threads.",
  "The kernel avoids unnecessary data copies by checking input contiguity instead of enforcing it with .contiguous().",
  "The kernel configures the grid size to maximize occupancy, capping it at a high number of blocks (e.g., 4096).",
  "The kernel prioritizes memory access patterns over localized optimizations like vectorized loads when the latter introduces fragmented access.",
  "The kernel minimizes synchronization and data transfer overhead by keeping results on the GPU and avoiding explicit synchronization within the kernel launch."
