  "The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations.",
  "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float2) to improve memory throughput.",
  "The kernel organizes thread blocks in dimensions that align with the data's spatial structure (e.g., 2D blocks for 2D data).",
  "The kernel employs __restrict__ qualifiers to enable compiler optimizations for non-aliased pointers.",
  "The kernel utilizes loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead.",
  "The kernel configures grid dimensions to combine batch and channel dimensions for improved memory locality.",
  "The kernel avoids intermediate global memory writes by retaining data in registers across fused operations.",
  "The kernel uses grid-stride loops that match tensor dimensions for coalesced memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread through vectorized conditional loads where possible.",
  "The kernel employs thread block sizes that maintain spatial locality for pooling window operations."
