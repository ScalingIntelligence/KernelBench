  "The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations.",
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel minimizes global memory traffic by keeping intermediate results in registers.",
  "The kernel uses boundary checks that are statically analyzable and less divergent.",
  "The kernel avoids framework overhead by implementing operations in a custom kernel rather than using multiple framework-provided operations."
