REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel loads all channel data for a spatial position into registers once and reuses it across multiple operations to reduce global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel stores frequently accessed parameters in shared memory to minimize global memory latency.",
    "The kernel uses thread-block mappings and indexing that enable coalesced global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.",
    "The kernel reduces redundant global memory reads by reusing data loaded into registers for subsequent computations instead of re-reading from global memory multiple times."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. Each statement captures a distinct optimization strategy employed in Kernel 1 compared to Kernel 2. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and focus on memory access patterns, data reuse, and efficient use of memory hierarchies (registers, shared memory). The rules are phrased to allow objective verification (e.g., checking for shared memory usage, analyzing memory access patterns for coalescing, or counting global memory accesses in the code).
