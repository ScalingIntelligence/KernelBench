  "The kernel uses a 1D grid and block structure to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations for coalesced writes.",
  "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses in output writes by organizing threads linearly, enabling full coalescing of global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel minimizes thread divergence and underutilization by using a grid configuration that closely matches the total number of output elements.",
  "The kernel prioritizes memory coalescing for write operations over read operations to maximize global memory efficiency."
