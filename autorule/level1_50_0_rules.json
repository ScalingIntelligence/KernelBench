  "The kernel uses loop unrolling via #pragma unroll directives for nested loops to improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel accesses input and weight tensors with contiguous memory patterns by iterating over channels (ic) in the innermost loop, ensuring coalesced memory operations.",
  "The kernel organizes output computations to ensure coalesced writes by mapping threads to contiguous output channel elements within spatial positions."
