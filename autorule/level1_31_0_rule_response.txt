REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses the --use_fast_math compiler flag to enable faster mathematical approximations.",
    "The kernel applies -O3 optimization level to the CUDA compiler for aggressive code optimization.",
    "The kernel avoids unnecessary header inclusions that do not contribute to the computation."
]


ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 1 uses `--use_fast_math` and `-O3` compiler flags, which optimize mathematical operations and code generation. These are generalizable, objective differences. The inclusion of unnecessary headers in Kernel 2 is also noted as a potential inefficiency. The rules are formatted as concise, deterministic statements applicable to CUDA kernels.
