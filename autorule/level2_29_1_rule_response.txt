REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a thread block size that allows higher occupancy by enabling more concurrent blocks per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).",
    "The kernel uses 32-bit integer types for indexing and size comparisons when values fit within 32-bit range to optimize arithmetic operations.",
    "The kernel minimizes register usage per thread by reducing the number of intermediate variables, thereby lowering register pressure and increasing occupancy."
