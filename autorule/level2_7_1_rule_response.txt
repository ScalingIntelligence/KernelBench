ANSWER:


The JSON array provided contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement is general and can be applied to other CUDA kernels for performance analysis. The first rule highlights the elimination of redundant operations, the second focuses on optimized index calculations, and the third emphasizes simplifying operation sequences to enhance efficiency. These rules are objective and deterministic, making them applicable to various kernel optimization scenarios.
