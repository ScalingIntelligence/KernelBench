REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses const qualifiers for variables to enable compiler optimizations such as better register allocation.",
    "The kernel avoids using log1pf in favor of logf with explicit arithmetic operations when numerical precision for small values is not critical.",
    "The kernel declares loop or thread-specific variables as const to reduce register pressure and improve instruction scheduling."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array above lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules focus on the use of `const` qualifiers to aid compiler optimizations, the choice of mathematical functions based on numerical requirements, and the impact of variable declaration strategies on register usage. Each statement is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
