ANSWER:


The two CUDA kernels provided are **functionally identical**, with no observable differences in their implementation. Both kernels use the same strategies for:

1. **Vectorized Memory Access**: Using `float4` for coalesced memory reads in `compute_means_bias_kernel`.
2. **Block-Level Reductions**: Shared memory reductions for summing channel values.
3. **Warp-Level Reductions**: Efficient warp shuffles for max/exp/sum operations in `logsumexp_scale_kernel`.
4. **Kernel Launch Configurations**: Identical block/grid dimensions and shared memory allocation.

The **0.1 ms runtime difference** (28.7 ms vs 28.8 ms) is likely due to **benchmarking noise** (e.g., GPU thermal state, background processes) rather than algorithmic differences. For meaningful optimization, focus on high-level strategies like kernel fusion or memory access patterns.
