REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's go through the reasoning step by step to extract the rule-like statements.

First, the user is comparing two CUDA kernels for channel_softmax. The key points from the reasoning are:

1. **Kernel 1** uses a spatial-first approach where each thread handles all channels for a single spatial position. This involves sequential processing of channels without synchronization. The block size is 256 threads, which is a multiple of the warp size (32). This leads to better GPU occupancy.

2. **Kernel 2** parallelizes across channels, using shared memory for reductions. Each block has C threads, which might not be optimal if C isn't a multiple of 32. The reductions require multiple synchronization steps and shared memory, which can lead to overhead and lower occupancy.

From this, the implied rules are:

- **Sequential processing over channels per thread** (Kernel 1's approach) avoids synchronization and shared memory overhead. This can be generalized as a rule about using sequential loops instead of parallel reductions when feasible.

- **Optimal block sizes** (like 256, which is a multiple of 32) improve occupancy. This relates to the example given (Example 3) about thread block sizes being multiples of warp size.

- **Avoiding shared memory for reductions** when possible, as in Kernel 1, which uses registers instead. This contrasts with Kernel 2's use of shared memory, which can limit occupancy.

- **Coalesced memory access patterns** are achieved in Kernel 1 by accessing consecutive memory locations, whereas Kernel 2's approach leads to uncoalesced accesses.

- **Reduction implementation**: Using sequential reductions in registers (Kernel 1) vs. parallel tree reductions with synchronization (Kernel 2). The former is more efficient here.

Now, translating these into general, objective rule-like statements:

1. The kernel uses sequential loops for reductions within a thread instead of parallel reductions across threads. (From Kernel 1's approach of looping over channels in a thread.)

2. The kernel configures thread block sizes as multiples of the warp size (32) to optimize occupancy. (As 256 is 8x32.)

3. The kernel avoids shared memory for intermediate reductions, using register storage instead. (Kernel 1 uses registers for max/sum.)

4. The kernel accesses memory with coalesced patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations. (Kernel 1's stride is optimized for coalescing.)

5. The kernel processes elements in a way that minimizes synchronization steps. (Kernel 1 has no syncthreads(), unlike Kernel 2.)

These are all objective and can be applied to various CUDA kernels. The shared memory point and block size are directly from the examples, but others are derived from the reasoning.
