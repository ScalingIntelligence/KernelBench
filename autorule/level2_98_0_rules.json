  "The kernel uses a faster approximation of the GELU activation function (tanh-based) instead of the exact erf-based implementation.",
  "The kernel uses a higher number of threads per block (up to 1024) to improve parallelism and occupancy.",
  "The kernel employs loop unrolling hints (#pragma unroll) for critical loops to reduce overhead and improve instruction scheduling.",
  "The kernel assigns one thread per group for processing, avoiding strided access patterns and improving memory locality.",
  "The kernel performs reductions directly in shared memory with a pattern that reduces register pressure and control divergence.",
  "The kernel avoids vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) that introduce packing/unpacking overhead in favor of simpler memory operations."
