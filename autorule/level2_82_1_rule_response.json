This reduces global memory traffic, a critical optimization.\n2. **Memory Coalescing**: Kernel 1\u2019s 3D grid ensures threads in a block access spatially contiguous input data, enabling efficient coalesced memory access patterns.\n3. **Loop Unrolling**: Explicit unrolling hints (`#pragma unroll`) allow the compiler to optimize pooling loops, reducing loop overhead and improving parallelism.\n4. **Index Reuse**: Precomputing `base_input_idx` outside loops minimizes redundant index calculations, lowering arithmetic overhead.",
