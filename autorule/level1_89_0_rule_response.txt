REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce the number of memory transactions and improve bandwidth utilization.",
    "The kernel employs a hierarchical parallel scan strategy by combining thread-local prefix sums with block-level reduction.",
    "The kernel applies aggressive loop unrolling to eliminate loop overhead and enhance instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel eliminates boundary checks to avoid warp divergence and conditional branch penalties.",
    "The kernel ensures perfectly coalesced memory access patterns through fixed row lengths and vector-aligned operations.",
    "The kernel optimizes shared memory usage for small reductions using algorithms like Kogge-Stone scan.",
    "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread with vectorization to minimize memory operations compared to scalar approaches."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 outperforms Kernel 2. Each statement is generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization strategies and can be objectively verified. The rules focus on vectorization, hierarchical parallelism, loop unrolling, boundary check elimination, memory coalescing, shared memory efficiency, and workload per threadâ€”all critical factors in optimizing GPU kernels. These principles are broadly applicable beyond the specific example, adhering to the requirement of generality.
