REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses read-only memory access for input data, enabling the use of the read-only data cache (e.g., via __ldg() intrinsic).",
    "The kernel uses explicit floating-point constants to avoid implicit type conversions and enable arithmetic optimizations.",
    "The kernel avoids in-place modifications of input data, allowing for better memory access optimizations."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about the performance difference between the two CUDA kernels. These rules focus on memory access patterns, constant usage, and in-place operation avoidance, which are generalizable to other CUDA kernel optimizations.

Key rules extracted:
1. **Read-only memory access** - Highlights the importance of const qualifiers for enabling read-only cache optimizations
2. **Explicit float constants** - Emphasizes proper constant typing to enable compiler optimizations
3. **In-place modification avoidance** - Suggests separating input/output buffers for better memory access patterns

These rules are objective and can be deterministically applied to analyze other CUDA kernels.
