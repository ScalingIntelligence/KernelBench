  "The kernel uses sequential division and modulus operations for index decomposition to reduce computational overhead.",
  "The kernel precomputes inverse kernel volume and uses multiplication instead of division for normalization.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns through linearized index calculations to improve cache utilization and coalescing.",
  "The kernel enables higher compiler optimization levels (e.g., -O3) for aggressive instruction scheduling and loop unrolling.",
  "The kernel reduces register pressure through optimized index reuse patterns in calculations."
