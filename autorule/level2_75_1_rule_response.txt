REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a strided loop pattern (i += block_size) to enable memory coalescing across warps during global memory access.",
    "The kernel is compiled with -O3 optimization flags for both host and device code to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel uses static shared memory allocation with a fixed size matching the block size to reduce launch overhead.",
    "The kernel employs template specialization to allow type-specific optimizations by the compiler."
