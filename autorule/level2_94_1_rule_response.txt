REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) only when input/output tensor dimensions are properly aligned to the vector size.",
    "The kernel avoids uncoalesced global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.",
    "The kernel uses block sizes that optimize occupancy based on register usage and GPU architecture constraints.",
    "The kernel minimizes branching overhead by ensuring loop unrolling or avoiding conditional tail-handling for vectorized operations.",
    "The kernel ensures tensor indices for vectorized loads/stores are correctly aligned to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "The kernel balances thread block size and elements per thread to optimize memory throughput and computational efficiency."
