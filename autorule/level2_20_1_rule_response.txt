REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses direct dimension parameters (N, C, D, H, W) for index calculations instead of precomputed aggregated values.",
    "The kernel benefits from compiler optimizations that eliminate redundant index calculations for contiguous memory access.",
    "The kernel's index breakdown into individual dimensions allows more efficient bitwise optimizations when dimensions are powers of two.",
    "The kernel uses templated types (scalar_t) to enable data-type-specific compiler optimizations."
