  "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop pattern to process multiple elements per thread.",
  "The kernel employs loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead.",
  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ qualifier to enable better compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel is compiled with -use_fast_math for faster approximate math operations.",
  "The kernel inlines computations rather than using separate device functions.",
  "The kernel adjusts grid dimensions based on elements processed per thread to improve occupancy.",
  "The kernel structures memory access patterns to enable better memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel utilizes register-level data reuse for intermediate values.",
  "The kernel caps grid dimensions to stay within architectural limits.",
  "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread iteration to increase arithmetic intensity."
