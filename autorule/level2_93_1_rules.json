  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access to process multiple elements per thread, improving memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel replaces transcendental functions (e.g., erf) with polynomial approximations (e.g., tanh-based) for faster computation.",
  "The kernel is compiled with --use_fast_math to enable approximate math optimizations and fused operations.",
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling via pragma directives to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel employs the __restrict__ keyword to indicate no pointer aliasing, enabling more aggressive compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel reduces the total number of threads required by processing multiple elements per thread, improving thread efficiency and occupancy."
