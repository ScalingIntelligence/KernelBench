REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. The runtimes are 7.31 ms vs 7.36 ms. The difference is small, but there must be some optimizations in Kernel 1 that make it a bit faster. Let me look at both kernels carefully.

First, looking at the fused_bias_hardtanh_mish_kernel in both versions. In Kernel 1, each thread processes a single element. The block size is 256, and the total elements are batch_size * out_features. The kernel uses a straightforward approach with each thread handling one element.

In Kernel 2, the same kernel uses vectorized loads. They process four elements per thread using float4. The block size here is 512, and the number of blocks is adjusted by multiplying block_size by 4. They also have elements_per_thread set to 4. This should, in theory, reduce the number of threads needed and increase memory throughput by using vectorized memory accesses. But wait, the runtime is slightly worse here. That's unexpected. Maybe there's something wrong with the vectorization approach here.

Wait, in Kernel 2, when they load the bias, they do (idx % out_features) but since idx is multiplied by 4 (because elements_per_thread is 4), the modulo operation might not correctly align. For example, if out_features is not a multiple of 4, the bias_data might be misaligned. That could cause uncoalesced memory accesses or even incorrect data being loaded. That would hurt performance. Oh, right! Because when they do idx = tid * 4, then (idx % out_features) would be (tid*4) % out_features. But the bias is per feature, so each thread's four elements should correspond to consecutive features. But if out_features isn't a multiple of 4, this could lead to incorrect indexing. For example, if out_features is 10, then for tid=2, idx=8, 8%10=8, so the bias_data would load elements 8,9,10,11, but 10 and 11 are out of bounds. That's a problem. This would cause memory access errors and possibly bank conflicts or uncoalesced accesses, leading to lower performance. So maybe the vectorization in Kernel 2 is not correctly handled, leading to inefficient memory access patterns. That could explain why it's slower than Kernel 1, which doesn't have this issue.

Another thing: in Kernel 2, the code uses *reinterpret_cast<const float4*> to load four floats at once. But for this to work correctly, the input and output tensors must be aligned properly. If the starting address isn't aligned to 16 bytes (since float4 is 16 bytes), this could cause misaligned loads, which are slower. If the total number of elements isn't a multiple of 4, the kernel has to handle the remaining elements, which adds some overhead. The code in Kernel 2 checks if remaining >=4, else does a loop. This tail handling might add some overhead, especially if there are many such cases. In contrast, Kernel 1 processes each element individually, so no such overhead.

Looking at the group_norm_kernel in both versions. In Kernel 1, they compute the variance as (sum_sq / channels_per_group - mean * mean). Then, during normalization, they compute sqrtf(var + epsilon). In Kernel 2, they use rsqrtf(var + epsilon), which is the reciprocal square root. Using rsqrtf is generally faster than computing 1/sqrtf, but in Kernel 1, they do sqrtf and then divide. Wait, in Kernel 1, the line is (x - mean) / sqrtf(var + epsilon), which is equivalent to (x - mean) * rsqrtf(var + epsilon). But in Kernel 2, they compute inv_std = rsqrtf(var + epsilon) and then multiply by that. So that's the same computation. However, rsqrtf is an intrinsic that approximates the reciprocal square root and is faster but less precise. However, the use of --use_fast_math in Kernel 2's compilation flags might enable more optimizations, like using lower-precision intrinsics. But in the group_norm_kernel of Kernel 2, they use rsqrtf, which is faster. Wait, but why would that make Kernel 2 slower? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the group norm code again.

Wait, in Kernel 1's group_norm_kernel, the code does:

float var = ...;
output[idx] = gamma[channel] * (x - mean) / sqrtf(var + epsilon) + beta[channel];

In Kernel 2, they compute inv_std = rsqrtf(var + epsilon), then multiply by inv_std. So (x - mean) * inv_std. That's the same as dividing by sqrtf. But rsqrtf is typically faster. So this part in Kernel 2 should be faster. But the overall runtime of Kernel 2 is worse. So maybe the problem is in the fused_bias_hardtanh_mish_kernel.

Another difference is the block sizes. Kernel 1 uses block_size=256 for the fused kernel, while Kernel 2 uses block_size=512. The number of blocks is calculated differently. For Kernel 1: (total_elements + 256 -1)/256. For Kernel 2: (total_elements + 512*4 -1)/(512*4). Wait, because in Kernel 2, each thread processes 4 elements, so the total number of threads needed is total_elements /4. So the number of blocks is (total_elements/4 + block_size -1)/block_size. But in Kernel 2's code, the calculation is (total_elements + block_size *4 -1)/(block_size *4). Wait, that's not correct. Let me check:

In Kernel 2, elements_per_thread is 4. So each thread handles 4 elements. So total threads needed is total_elements /4. The block_size is 512. So the number of blocks should be (total_elements /4 + 512 -1)/512. But in the code, they compute num_blocks as (total_elements + 512*4 -1)/(512*4). Let's see: 512*4 is 2048. So (total_elements + 2047)/2048. But total_elements is batch_size * out_features. Suppose total_elements is N. Then the number of threads is ceil(N/4). Each block has 512 threads. So blocks needed: ceil(ceil(N/4)/512) = ceil(N/(4*512)) = ceil(N/2048). Which is the same as (N + 2047)/2048. So the code in Kernel 2 is correct here. So the number of blocks is correctly calculated. So that's not the issue.

But the problem with the bias access remains. Because in Kernel 2, when they load the bias as float4, the index is (idx % out_features). But idx is the element index in the input array. For example, if the input is a 2D tensor of [batch_size, out_features], then each element in the input is at position [i][j], where i is the batch index and j is the feature. The bias is of size out_features. So for each element in the input, you add bias[j]. In Kernel 1, j is calculated as idx % out_features, which is correct because idx is i * out_features + j. So j is the feature index.

But in Kernel 2, when they process four elements per thread, the idx is tid *4. So for each thread, the four elements are at positions tid*4, tid*4+1, tid*4+2, tid*4+3. The corresponding j for each element is (tid*4 + k) % out_features, where k is 0-3. Wait, no. Because the original idx in the input is (i * out_features + j). So when you have a flattened array, the j for each element is (global_idx) % out_features, where global_idx is the index in the flattened array. So in Kernel 2, when they process four elements starting at idx = tid *4, each of those four elements has j = (idx + k) % out_features for k=0,1,2,3. But the code in Kernel 2 does:

float4 bias_data = *reinterpret_cast<const float4*>(bias + (idx % out_features));

So for the four elements, they are using the same bias[j], j = idx % out_features, but then adding k to j? Wait, no. Because idx is the starting index of the four elements. For example, if idx is 5, then the four elements are 5,6,7,8. The j for each of these is 5%out_features, 6%out_features, etc. But the code in Kernel 2 is taking the bias starting at (idx % out_features) and then reading four consecutive elements. But the correct j for each element in the four is (idx +k) % out_features, not (idx % out_features) +k. So if out_features is not a multiple of 4, this would cause the bias indices to be incorrect. For example, if out_features is 10, and idx is 8, then idx%out_features is 8. The code would load bias[8], bias[9], bias[10], bias[11], but bias is only size 10. This is an out-of-bounds access, leading to incorrect values and possible memory errors. This is a critical bug. So the vectorization in Kernel 2's fused kernel is incorrect. This would not only produce wrong results but also cause uncoalesced memory accesses and possibly even crashes. However, the user says both kernels are correct, so maybe in their test case, out_features is a multiple of 4. But if that's not the case in general, this code would fail. However, assuming that the user's scenario has out_features as a multiple of 4, then the code would work. But even then, the way the bias is accessed is not correct. Because for each element in the four, the j should be (idx +k) % out_features. But the code is using (idx % out_features) +k. For example, if idx is 10 and out_features is 8, then idx%out_features is 2. So the code would load bias[2],3,4,5. But the correct j for elements 10,11,12,13 would be 2,3,4,5 (since 10%8=2, 11%8=3, etc.), which in this case would be correct. Wait, because (idx +k) % out_features = (10 +0)%8=2, (10+1)%8=3, etc. So (idx%out_features) +k would be 2+0=2, 2+1=3, etc., which is correct. But only if idx%out_features +k < out_features. For example, if idx%out_features is 6 and k=3, then 6+3=9, which is out of bounds if out_features is 8. So in that case, the code would access bias[6],7,8,9, which is invalid. So this approach is only correct when (idx%out_features) +3 < out_features. Which would require that (idx%out_features) <= out_features -4. But idx can be any value. So this is a problem. Therefore, the vectorization in Kernel 2's fused kernel is incorrect, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when (idx%out_features) +k >= out_features. This would cause incorrect results and possible segmentation faults. However, the user says both kernels are correct, so perhaps in their specific case, out_features is a multiple of 4, making (idx%out_features) +k always within bounds. But even then, the code is not general and would fail for other values of out_features. 

But assuming that the user's test case has out_features as a multiple of 4, then the code would work. However, the way the bias is loaded in Kernel 2 is coalesced. For example, consecutive threads accessing consecutive memory addresses. But if the code is incorrectly accessing the bias, even with vectorization, the performance could be worse due to uncoalesced accesses. For example, if each thread is loading a float4 from the bias, but the addresses are not properly aligned or consecutive, this could lead to more memory transactions. In Kernel 1, each thread accesses bias[j], where j is the feature index, which is contiguous across threads in the same feature. So if multiple threads in a warp are accessing the same j (since they are in the same feature across different batches), that would cause bank conflicts. Wait, in Kernel 1, for a given feature j, all elements in the batch dimension will access bias[j]. So if the threads in a warp are processing different batch elements for the same j, they all read the same bias[j]. This is a broadcast scenario, which is efficient on GPUs because the value can be read once and broadcast to all threads in the warp. But in Kernel 2, when using vectorized loads, if the bias is being accessed with float4, but the features are not contiguous in a way that allows for coalesced access, it could lead to more memory transactions. For example, if each thread is accessing a different feature's bias, but in a non-sequential way, the memory accesses would be scattered, leading to lower efficiency.

Another difference is the use of --use_fast_math in Kernel 2's compilation flags. This flag enables faster but less accurate math operations, such as using approximate transcendental functions. However, in the fused kernel of Kernel 2, they compute log1pf(expf(val)), which is the same as in Kernel 1. The --use_fast_math might make these functions faster but less precise. However, the impact on runtime could vary. Sometimes, using fast math can improve performance, but in this case, it's part of Kernel 2 which is slower. So maybe the other factors, like the incorrect vectorization leading to uncoalesced memory accesses, are outweighing the benefits of --use_fast_math.

Looking at the group_norm_kernel in both versions. Kernel 2 uses rsqrtf instead of computing sqrtf and then dividing. rsqrtf is typically faster, so this should help. However, the overall runtime of Kernel 2 is worse. So the problem must be in the fused_bias_hardtanh_mish_kernel.

Putting it all together: Kernel 2's fused kernel has incorrect vectorization leading to uncoalesced memory accesses and possible out-of-bounds errors (though the user says it's correct, so maybe their specific case avoids this). However, even if the code is correct, the way they access the bias may not be optimal. For example, in Kernel 1, each thread accesses a single bias element, which is the same across the batch dimension. This allows for efficient broadcasting and reuse. In Kernel 2, each thread processes four elements, which may belong to different features (if the batch size is such that consecutive elements in the flattened array are from different features). Wait, no. The input is of shape [batch_size, out_features]. When flattened, the elements are ordered as [batch_0 feature_0, batch_0 feature_1, ..., batch_0 feature_{out-1}, batch_1 feature_0, ...]. So for the fused kernel, each thread in Kernel 1 processes a single element, with j = idx % out_features. So for consecutive threads in the same warp, j increments by 1 until the end of the features, then wraps around. For example, threads 0-31 in a warp would process j=0,1,2,...,31 (assuming out_features >=32). So each thread in the warp accesses consecutive bias elements, leading to a coalesced access pattern. The entire warp would read a contiguous block of 32 bias elements, which is efficient.

In Kernel 2, each thread processes four consecutive elements. For example, thread 0 processes elements 0-3 (features 0-3), thread 1 processes 4-7, etc. So when accessing the bias, each thread reads four consecutive features. This should also be coalesced, as consecutive threads access consecutive 4-feature blocks. However, if out_features is not a multiple of 4, the last few elements may be misaligned. But assuming it's a multiple of 4, this should be efficient. However, the problem arises in how the bias is loaded. In Kernel 2, the code does:

float4 bias_data = *reinterpret_cast<const float4*>(bias + (idx % out_features));

But idx here is the element index in the input. For example, if the input is a batch of 2 elements and out_features is 4, then the elements are [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The idx for the first thread (tid=0) would be 0*4=0. So bias_data is loaded from bias[0],1,2,3. The next thread (tid=1) would have idx=4, so bias[4%4=0], leading to the same bias elements. Wait, no! Because if out_features is 4, then idx=4 would be 4%4=0. So the code would load bias[0],1,2,3 again. But the correct j for idx=4 (which is batch 1, feature 0) is j=0. So the code is adding bias[0] to the input element. That's correct. Similarly, idx=5 would be 5%4=1, so bias[1],2,3,4 (but out_features is 4, so 4 is out of bounds). Wait, this is a problem. If out_features is 4, then the code in Kernel 2 for idx=4 (element 4 in the input, which is batch 1, feature 0) would load bias[0],1,2,3. Then, the four elements processed by the thread are input[4],5,6,7. Each of these should add bias[0],1,2,3 respectively. But for input[4] (batch 1, feature 0), the correct bias is bias[0]. For input[5] (batch 1, feature 1), bias[1], etc. So in this case, the code is correct. Because for idx=4, the four elements are 4,5,6,7. Their j's are 0,1,2,3. So the code loads bias[0],1,2,3, which is correct. So in this case, the code works. But if out_features is not a multiple of 4, then the code would have issues. But assuming out_features is a multiple of 4, the code is correct. However, the way the code is written, the bias is being accessed in a way that each thread's four elements use the same four consecutive bias values. But in reality, each element in the four should use a different bias value. Wait, no. For example, in the input, each element is part of a different batch but the same feature. Wait, no. The input is [batch_size, out_features]. So when flattened, the elements are ordered as batch_0_feature_0, batch_0_feature_1, ..., batch_0_feature_{out-1}, batch_1_feature_0, etc. So for a thread processing four elements starting at idx, those four elements are consecutive in the flattened array, which means they are consecutive features for the same batch or wrap around to the next batch. For example, if out_features is 4 and batch_size is 2, then idx=0-3 are batch 0 features 0-3. idx=4-7 are batch 1 features 0-3. So for idx=0, the four elements are features 0-3 of batch 0, and the corresponding biases are 0-3. So the code correctly loads bias[0-3]. For idx=4, the four elements are features 0-3 of batch 1, and the code again loads bias[0-3]. So this is correct. So in this scenario, the code works. But if out_features is larger than 4, say 8, and a thread processes four elements starting at idx=0, those would be features 0-3 of batch 0, and the code loads bias[0-3]. Then the next thread (idx=4) would process features 4-7 of batch 0, and load bias[4-7]. That's correct. So as long as out_features is a multiple of 4, the code works. However, if out_features is not a multiple of 4, the code would have incorrect behavior. But the user says both kernels are correct, so perhaps in their case, out_features is a multiple of 4. 

Assuming that, why is Kernel 1 faster? Let's think about memory access patterns. In Kernel 1, each thread processes one element. The block size is 256. In Kernel 2, each thread processes four elements with block size 512. The total number of threads launched in Kernel 1 is (total_elements + 255)/256. In Kernel 2, it's (total_elements + 2047)/2048 * 512. Wait, no. The number of blocks in Kernel 2 is (total_elements + 2047)/2048, and each block has 512 threads. So total threads launched is 512 * num_blocks. Each thread processes 4 elements. So for total_elements= N, the number of threads is ceil(N/4). For example, if N=4096, Kernel 1 launches 4096/256=16 blocks, 16*256=4096 threads. Kernel 2: ceil(4096/4)=1024 threads. 1024/512=2 blocks. So 2*512=1024 threads. Each thread processes 4 elements. So the total number of threads is lower, which can lead to better occupancy if the block size is optimal. But block size 512 may not be optimal. CUDA GPUs have a maximum number of threads per block (1024), but the optimal block size depends on the GPU's compute capability and the kernel's resource usage. Using 512 threads per block may lead to lower occupancy compared to 256 if the kernel uses a lot of registers or shared memory. But in this case, the fused kernel doesn't use shared memory, so register usage is the main factor. If Kernel 2's fused kernel uses more registers per thread (due to processing four elements), it could lead to lower occupancy. 

Another factor is instruction-level parallelism. Processing four elements per thread can hide latency better if the operations are independent. However, in this case, each element's computation is independent, so the four elements can be processed in parallel using vectorized operations. However, the code uses #pragma unroll, which unrolls the loop, possibly improving instruction scheduling. But the overhead of handling the remaining elements (the if (remaining >=4) part) could add branching overhead. However, if the total elements are a multiple of 4, this part is not executed, so no overhead. But if not, there's a small overhead. 

Another thing to consider is that in Kernel 2, the code uses float4 loads and stores, which can improve memory throughput by reducing the number of memory transactions. Each float4 load is a single memory transaction that fetches 16 bytes, whereas four separate float loads would require four transactions (if not coalesced). So using vectorized loads can significantly improve memory efficiency. However, this is only true if the data is properly aligned and the access pattern is coalesced. In Kernel 2, if the input and output tensors are properly aligned (which they are, as PyTorch tensors are aligned by default), then the float4 accesses should be more efficient. But why is Kernel 1 faster then? 

Wait, maybe the problem is in the bias access. In Kernel 1, each thread reads a single bias value (bias[j]), which is reused across the batch. For example, for a given feature j, all batch elements will add the same bias[j]. In Kernel 1, when multiple threads in the same warp are processing the same feature j (different batches), they all read the same bias[j]. This allows the GPU to broadcast the value from the cache, reducing memory traffic. In contrast, in Kernel 2, each thread reads four consecutive bias values. If the features are consecutive, then the threads in a warp would read consecutive bias values, which is coalesced. For example, if a warp of 32 threads processes 32*4=128 elements, each thread reads 4 consecutive bias values. So the total bias data read by the warp is 32*4=128 elements, which is 128*4=512 bytes. This can be loaded in 512/32=16 transactions (assuming 32-byte cache lines). But if the access is coalesced, it could be more efficient. However, in Kernel 1, each thread in the warp reads the same bias[j] (if they are processing the same feature across different batches), which is a single value broadcasted to all threads, requiring only one memory transaction. But if the threads in the warp are processing different features, then each thread reads a different bias[j], which would be scattered. However, in the input tensor, consecutive threads in a block are likely processing consecutive features for the same batch. For example, in Kernel 1, the block is 1D, so threadIdx.x determines the position. For a block of 256 threads, each thread processes an element in the batch. For example, if the batch size is 1000 and out_features is 100, then each thread in the block processes a different element in the batch. Wait, no. The total elements are batch_size * out_features. The kernel is launched with 1D grid and block. So each thread processes a single element in the flattened input. So the index is calculated as blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x. So for example, if blockIdx.x is 0 and threadIdx.x ranges from 0 to 255, the threads process elements 0-255. If the out_features is 100, then these elements correspond to batch 0 features 0-99, batch 1 features 0-99, etc. So consecutive threads in a warp (say, 32 threads) would process elements 0-31, which are batch 0 features 0-31. So each thread in the warp is processing a different feature, so each reads a different bias[j]. This requires the warp to read 32 different bias elements. If these 32 elements are contiguous in memory (since j ranges from 0 to 31), then the warp can read them in a single coalesced transaction. So in this case, Kernel 1's bias access is coalesced. 

In Kernel 2, each thread reads four consecutive bias elements. For example, thread 0 reads bias[0-3], thread 1 reads bias[4-7], etc. If the warp has 32 threads, they read 32*4=128 consecutive bias elements. This can be done with efficient coalesced memory transactions. So both kernels should have efficient bias access patterns. 

But why is Kernel 1 faster? Let's look at the arithmetic intensity. In Kernel 1, each thread does:

x = input + bias[j]
clamp to [-1,1]
compute sp = log1p(exp(x))
tanh(sp)
output = x * tanh_sp

In Kernel 2, each thread does the same operations but for four elements. The code uses #pragma unroll to unroll the loop. Unrolling can reduce loop overhead and improve instruction scheduling. However, using float4 may increase register pressure. Each thread in Kernel 2 has to store four elements' intermediate values (in_data, bias_data, out_data), which may require more registers. If the kernel is register-bound, this could limit occupancy. For example, if each thread in Kernel 1 uses 20 registers, and each thread in Kernel 2 uses 20*4=80 registers (unlikely, but possible), then the number of threads per block would be limited by the available registers. However, the block size in Kernel 2 is 512, which is larger than Kernel 1's 256. If the kernel uses more registers, the occupancy could be lower. Let's check the possible register usage.

In Kernel 1, each thread processes one element. The variables are x, sp, tanh_sp. So maybe around 5-10 registers. In Kernel 2, each thread processes four elements, so variables are in_data (float4), bias_data (float4), out_data (float4), and then each element's x, sp, tanh_sp. But since they are processed in a loop, the compiler might reuse registers. However, with unrolling, each iteration of the loop would have its own variables, increasing register usage. If the loop is unrolled, the code would have four sets of variables, increasing register pressure. This could lead to lower occupancy because the number of threads per block is limited by the available registers. Lower occupancy means fewer active warps to hide latency, leading to lower performance. 

Another factor is that Kernel 2 uses a block size of 512, which may not be optimal for the GPU. For example, if the GPU's maximum threads per block is 1024, but the optimal size is 256 or 128, then using 512 could lead to lower occupancy. However, this depends on the specific GPU architecture. 

Additionally, the tail handling in Kernel 2's fused kernel could introduce some overhead. Even if the total elements are a multiple of 4, the code still checks if (remaining >=4) and handles the remaining elements. This adds a branch in the code. However, in cases where the total elements are a multiple of 4, the branch is always taken, so no overhead. But the presence of the branch could potentially affect the compiler's optimization or introduce some overhead. 

Another possible factor is the use of log1pf(expf(x)) in both kernels. In Kernel 2, with --use_fast_math, this could be approximated, but the impact on runtime might be minimal. 

Putting it all together, the main reasons Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2 are:

1. **Vectorization Overhead in Kernel 2**: Although vectorized loads can improve memory throughput, the incorrect handling of bias indices (when out_features is not a multiple of 4) leads to uncoalesced memory accesses or out-of-bounds errors. Even if the user's specific case avoids this, the additional overhead of handling the tail elements and potential register pressure from processing four elements per thread may reduce performance.

2. **Block Size and Occupancy**: Kernel 1 uses a block size of 256, which is often a good balance between occupancy and resource usage. Kernel 2 uses a block size of 512, which might lead to lower occupancy if the kernel is register-bound, reducing the GPU's ability to hide latency.

3. **Register Pressure**: Processing four elements per thread in Kernel 2 may increase register usage, limiting the number of concurrent threads and reducing occupancy, which can degrade performance.

4. **Coalesced Memory Access**: In Kernel 1, each thread accesses a single bias element, which, when consecutive threads access consecutive bias elements, results in efficient coalesced memory reads. In Kernel 2, the vectorized access might not be as efficient if the bias accesses are not properly aligned or if the memory transactions are not fully coalesced.

5. **Fast Math Compilation Flag**: While Kernel 2 uses --use_fast_math to enable faster math operations, the benefits might be offset by the other inefficiencies in the kernel, such as increased register pressure or suboptimal memory access patterns.

In conclusion, the primary reasons for Kernel 1's better performance are more efficient memory access patterns, better occupancy due to optimal block size and lower register pressure, and the absence of overhead from vectorization handling in the fused kernel.


ANSWER:


The performance difference between Kernel 1 and Kernel 2 stems from optimizations and inefficiencies in their fused `bias_hardtanh_mish` kernels. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. **Vectorization Overhead in Kernel 2**
   - **Issue**: Kernel 2 uses `float4` vectorized loads but has a critical flaw in bias indexing. The code `bias + (idx % out_features)` assumes `out_features` is a multiple of 4. When this isn't true, it causes misaligned memory accesses or out-of-bounds errors, leading to uncoalesced memory transactions and reduced throughput.
   - **Impact**: Even when `out_features` is a multiple of 4, the tail-handling logic (`if (remaining >= 4)`) introduces branching overhead, and increased register pressure from processing 4 elements per thread reduces GPU occupancy.

### 2. **Block Size and Occupancy**
   - **Kernel 1**: Uses a block size of 256, balancing occupancy and resource usage. This allows more concurrent warps to hide latency.
   - **Kernel 2**: Uses a larger block size (512), which may reduce occupancy if register usage per thread is high (due to processing 4 elements), limiting parallelism.

### 3. **Memory Access Patterns**
   - **Kernel 1**: Each thread accesses a single `bias` element. Consecutive threads in a warp access consecutive `bias` values, enabling coalesced reads.
   - **Kernel 2**: Vectorized `float4` bias loads are only efficient if aligned and contiguous. Misalignment (due to incorrect indexing) or partial vectors degrades memory throughput.

### 4. **Fast Math Trade-offs**
   - Kernel 2 compiles with `--use_fast_math`, enabling approximate intrinsics like `rsqrtf`. However, the gains are offset by the fused kernel's inefficiencies, negating potential benefits.

### Summary
Kernel 1 avoids the overhead of vectorization mishandling, uses a more optimal block size, and maintains efficient coalesced memory access. Kernel 2's vectorization introduces uncoalesced accesses and register pressure, outweighing the benefits of `--use_fast_math` and warp shuffling optimizations in the group norm kernel.
