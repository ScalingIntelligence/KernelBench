  "The kernel separates vectorized processing and remainder handling into distinct loops to avoid branch divergence in the main loop.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable better compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel focuses __ldg (texture cache) usage on frequently reused data (e.g., vector B) while avoiding it for per-thread unique data (e.g., matrix A).",
  "The kernel avoids conditional checks for vector alignment within the main processing loop to improve instruction pipelining efficiency.",
  "The kernel handles remainder elements in a separate loop after processing aligned vector loads to minimize warp divergence."
