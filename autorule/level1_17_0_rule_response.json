  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These rules focus on optimizations such as **register blocking** to enhance arithmetic intensity, **coalesced memory access** for efficient global memory usage, **shared memory transposition** to avoid bank conflicts, **larger tile sizes** for data reuse, **loop unrolling** to minimize overhead, and **specialization** for targeted hardware optimization. Each rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels in general, making them valuable for performance tuning.",
