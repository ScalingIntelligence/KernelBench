  "response": "\n\nThe analysis identifies several key optimizations in Kernel 2 that contribute to its slightly better performance. These optimizations are distilled into generalizable rules applicable to CUDA kernel design. The rules focus on memory access patterns, index calculation efficiency, and arithmetic structure, which are critical for optimizing GPU performance. By ensuring tensor contiguity, leveraging cache coherence, and optimizing arithmetic operations, Kernel 2 achieves better hardware utilization. These rules can guide the development of efficient CUDA kernels across various applications.",
