REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration for element-wise operations to ensure coalesced global memory access.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory access patterns by processing contiguous elements in a single thread block.",
    "The kernel splits operations into separate phases (statistics computation and normalization) to optimize memory access patterns independently.",
    "The kernel processes elements with consecutive thread indices accessing consecutive memory addresses to maximize memory throughput."
