  "The kernel specializes for a specific kernel size (3x3) and fixed parameters (stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1, no bias), eliminating conditional checks for general cases.",
  "The kernel fully unrolls all loops (input channels, kernel height, kernel width) using #pragma unroll, reducing loop overhead and enabling compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel uses a 3D grid layout (batch, output channels, output height) with 1D thread blocks aligned to output width dimensions, improving memory coalescing for output accesses.",
  "The kernel simplifies input index calculations by assuming fixed stride and padding, avoiding complex coordinate transformations and boundary checks during memory access.",
  "The kernel eliminates support for dynamic features like groups, dilation, and bias, reducing per-thread computational overhead and branch divergence.",
  "The kernel aligns thread block dimensions with output tensor layout to ensure contiguous memory access patterns across warps."
