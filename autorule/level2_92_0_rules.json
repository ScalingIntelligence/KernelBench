  "The kernel uses PyTorch's optimized native operations (e.g., GroupNorm) instead of custom implementations.",
  "The kernel separates complex fused operations into simpler, element-wise kernels to improve memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel implements custom reductions (e.g., LogSumExp) tailored to specific tensor dimensions for parallel efficiency.",
  "The kernel reduces register pressure by splitting operations into separate kernels, enabling higher GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel uses 1D grid layouts and standard thread block sizes (e.g., 256 threads) for efficient thread scheduling.",
  "The kernel avoids strided memory access patterns by processing contiguous elements in element-wise operations.",
  "The kernel leverages optimized libraries (e.g., cuDNN/cuBLAS) for computationally intensive operations like GroupNorm."
