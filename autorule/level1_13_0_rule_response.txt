ANSWER:


The two CUDA kernels provided are **identical** in their implementation. There is no discernible difference in the code that would account for the slight runtime variation (46.8 ms vs. 46.4 ms). The observed difference is likely due to **external factors**, such as:

1. **Measurement Noise**: GPU execution times can vary slightly due to background processes, thermal throttling, or other system-level fluctuations.
2. **Cache Effects**: Differences in cache warm-up between runs might cause minor timing discrepancies.
3. **Non-Deterministic GPU Behavior**: GPU scheduling and memory access patterns can introduce variability, even for identical kernels.

**Key Observations:**
- Both kernels use the same tiling strategy (`TILE_SIZE = 32`).
- Shared memory usage and indexing patterns are identical.
- Global memory accesses are coalesced in both cases.
- Loop structures, synchronization points, and arithmetic operations are the same.

**Conclusion:** The runtime difference is not due to algorithmic or implementation differences in the kernels. For meaningful performance comparisons, multiple runs with statistical averaging should be performed to account for measurement variability.
