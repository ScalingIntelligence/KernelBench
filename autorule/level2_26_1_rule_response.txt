Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop to process multiple elements per thread, improving thread utilization for large datasets.",
    "The kernel includes complex index calculations involving divisions and modulos for multi-dimensional tensor access, which increases computational overhead.",
    "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to enable coalesced memory accesses.",
    "The kernel avoids unnecessary parameter handling (e.g., unused bias) to reduce redundant computations and memory accesses.",
    "The kernel uses a simple 1D grid/block mapping with linear indexing to maintain memory access coalescing.",
    "The kernel minimizes arithmetic operations per thread by avoiding redundant dimension decomposition calculations."

These statements capture the key performance-related differences between the kernels while maintaining generality for application to other CUDA implementations. They focus on: 
1. Memory access patterns
2. Thread utilization strategies
3. Computational complexity
4. Parameter handling efficiency
5. Tensor layout optimization
6. Arithmetic operation minimization
