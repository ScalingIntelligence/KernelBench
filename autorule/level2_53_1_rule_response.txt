REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general, objective, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses a grid-stride loop with vectorization, processing 4 elements per thread. This suggests a general rule about using grid-stride loops and vectorization to handle multiple elements per thread. 

Next, the use of `#pragma unroll` in Kernel 2's loop is highlighted. This points to loop unrolling as an optimization technique, so that's another rule.

Kernel 2 employs the `__restrict__` qualifier, which helps the compiler optimize by indicating no pointer aliasing. That's a specific CUDA optimization technique.

The `-use_fast_math` compiler flag is used in Kernel 2, enabling faster math operations. This is a compiler-level optimization, so that's a rule.

Inlining the GELU calculation instead of using a separate device function is mentioned. This relates to avoiding function call overhead, so inlining computations would be a rule.

The grid size calculation in Kernel 2 is adjusted to account for processing multiple elements per thread, which optimizes grid dimensions. This is about adjusting grid size based on elements per thread.

Memory coalescing is improved by accessing consecutive elements, which is a result of vectorization. So, structuring memory access for coalescing is another rule.

Using a local array (`results[4]`) for register-level data reuse is mentioned. This suggests using registers to reuse data and reduce memory accesses.

Capping the grid size at 65535 blocks is noted, which relates to adhering to hardware limits for grid dimensions.

Putting these together, each identified optimization technique becomes a rule. I need to ensure they're phrased generally, not specific to the example. For instance, "processes multiple elements per thread using a grid-stride loop" instead of mentioning 4 elements. Similarly, using `__restrict__` is a specific CUDA practice. The rules should be concise and applicable across different kernels.
