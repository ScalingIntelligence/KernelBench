  "The kernel replaces division with multiplication by a precomputed reciprocal to reduce computational overhead.",
  "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization flags (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel reduces global memory accesses by leveraging fused operations from optimized library functions (e.g., cuBLAS) instead of custom implementations.",
  "The kernel minimizes the number of arithmetic operations per thread by offloading intermediate steps (e.g., bias addition) to optimized external operations."
