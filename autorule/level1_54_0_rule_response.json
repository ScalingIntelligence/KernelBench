  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. Each statement captures a specific optimization technique or practice applied in Kernel 2 that contributes to its superior performance. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel development and can be objectively verified (e.g., checking for `#pragma unroll`, analyzing memory access patterns, or inspecting compiler flags). The rules avoid implementation-specific details, focusing instead on broader optimization strategies applicable across different kernels.",
