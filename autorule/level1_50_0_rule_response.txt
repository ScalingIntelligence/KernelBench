REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses loop unrolling via #pragma unroll directives for nested loops to improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel accesses input and weight tensors with contiguous memory patterns by iterating over channels (ic) in the innermost loop, ensuring coalesced memory operations.",
    "The kernel organizes output computations to ensure coalesced writes by mapping threads to contiguous output channel elements within spatial positions."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules focus on observable, deterministic optimizations in the CUDA kernels, such as loop unrolling, memory access patterns, and thread-to-output mapping strategies. The minor runtime difference was attributed to measurement noise, but the extracted rules reflect generalizable optimizations applicable to other CUDA implementations.
