REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a multi-dimensional grid configuration (3D grid with 2D thread blocks) to improve spatial locality and enable coalesced memory accesses.",
    "The kernel employs loop unrolling via pragma directives to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel organizes threads to process the same channel within a block, improving cache utilization for weight reuse.",
    "The kernel minimizes expensive integer division and modulo operations through direct grid/thread index mapping for output position calculation.",
    "The kernel ensures contiguous memory access patterns for both input reads and output writes through thread organization, enabling full coalescing of memory transactions.",
    "The kernel groups spatial computations for a single channel within a block to optimize weight memory access patterns through spatial reuse."

ANSWER:


Here is the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

    "The kernel ensures contiguous memory access patterns for both input reads and output writes through thread organization, enabling full coalescing of memory transactions.",
    "The kernel groups spatial computations for a single channel within a block to optimize weight memory access patterns through spatial reuse."

These statements capture the key optimization principles applied in the faster kernel while maintaining generality for application to other CUDA kernels.
