  "The kernel fuses multiple operations into a single kernel to avoid intermediate global memory writes and reads.",
  "The kernel performs parallel reductions for sum and squared sum using separate shared memory arrays in a single pass.",
  "The kernel avoids unnecessary synchronization primitives (e.g., __syncthreads()) when using warp-sized thread blocks.",
  "The kernel minimizes global memory bandwidth usage by retaining intermediate results in registers or shared memory instead of global memory.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that match the warp size (32 threads) to enable implicit warp-level synchronization.",
  "The kernel reduces kernel launch overhead by combining multiple operations into fewer kernel launches."
