  "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop to process multiple elements per thread, reducing the total number of threads launched.",
  "The kernel caps the grid size to a maximum value (e.g., 65535 blocks) to limit the number of atomic operations on global memory.",
  "The kernel reduces the number of atomic operations by aggregating results locally (e.g., via thread-local sums) before performing block-level atomic updates.",
  "The kernel optimizes GPU resource utilization by balancing the number of blocks and threads to minimize scheduling overhead and improve occupancy."
