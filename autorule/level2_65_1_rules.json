  "The kernel uses warp-level reductions with shuffle instructions instead of shared memory-based block reductions.",
  "The kernel replaces division with multiplication by precomputing the reciprocal of a constant value.",
  "The kernel unrolls loops using #pragma unroll to reduce loop overhead.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel employs sequential memory access patterns to improve memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel uses fast math operations (e.g., __expf) enabled by compiler flags for approximate calculations.",
  "The kernel avoids atomic operations by ensuring each block writes to a unique output location.",
  "The kernel processes elements at warp granularity to align with GPU execution units and reduce divergence."
