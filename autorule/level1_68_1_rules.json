  "The kernel orders loops such that validity checks for kernel positions are performed before iterating over input channels, reducing redundant checks and iterations.",
  "The kernel minimizes the number of validity checks by checking kernel positions once per output element rather than per input channel and kernel position.",
  "The kernel reduces the number of operations by skipping entire input channel loops when kernel positions are invalid."
