REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a custom implementation for fused operations to reduce overhead from generalized library functions.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns by iterating over contiguous dimensions in innermost loops to ensure coalesced memory accesses.",
    "The kernel employs a grid configuration that maximizes parallelism across GPU streaming multiprocessors by distributing work along independent dimensions (e.g., channels, batches).",
    "The kernel aligns loop ordering with memory layout (contiguous dimensions innermost) to improve cache efficiency and sequential memory access."
