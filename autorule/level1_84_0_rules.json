  "The kernel uses a 1D grid structure with one thread per output element to enable better load balancing and GPU utilization.",
  "The kernel unrolls loops using compiler pragmas (e.g., #pragma unroll) to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction scheduling.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns to achieve better coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.",
  "The kernel uses compiler flags (e.g., -use_fast_math) to enable faster floating-point operations at the expense of precision.",
  "The kernel employs boolean parameters for conditional checks (e.g., has_bias) to enable better branch optimization compared to runtime pointer checks.",
  "The kernel avoids loop-based thread divergence by assigning each thread to process exactly one output element.",
  "The kernel pre-calculates indices upfront using constant variables to optimize index computation efficiency."
