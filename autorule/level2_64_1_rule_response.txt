### Explanation of Rules:
1. **Vectorized Memory Access**: Explicitly mentions the use of vectorized loads (e.g., `float4`) to optimize memory operations.
2. **Shared Memory Minimization**: Highlights reduced shared memory usage to improve occupancy.
3. **Contiguous Access Patterns**: Contrasts with strided access for better memory efficiency.
4. **Approximated Functions**: Directly compares `tanhf` vs. `erff` for computational efficiency.
5. **Shared Memory Reuse**: Indicates buffer reuse across phases to reduce allocation.
6. **Fused Activations**: Explicitly links fused operations to reduced branching. 

All rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to general CUDA kernel optimization.
