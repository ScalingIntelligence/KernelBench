REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a one-thread-per-element approach to ensure coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel avoids conditional checks for handling non-vector-aligned elements, reducing warp divergence.",
    "The kernel uses a higher number of threads with lower register usage per thread to improve occupancy.",
    "The kernel minimizes control flow complexity by processing elements without vectorization-related branching.",
    "The kernel prioritizes thread-level parallelism over per-thread workload to better hide latency in compute-bound operations."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These statements generalize the key differences between the kernels, focusing on memory access patterns, occupancy, control flow, and parallelism strategies. They are objective and applicable to CUDA kernel design beyond this specific example.
