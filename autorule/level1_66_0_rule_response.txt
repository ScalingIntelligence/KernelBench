REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a multi-dimensional grid structure to group threads processing spatially adjacent output elements, improving memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel minimizes index calculation overhead by leveraging block and thread indices directly for spatial mapping.",
    "The kernel's memory access pattern ensures consecutive threads access contiguous memory locations, enabling stride-1 accesses.",
    "The kernel aligns weight tensor indexing with the memory layout to improve cache utilization.",
    "The kernel avoids flat index unraveling with division/modulo operations, reducing computational overhead and register usage."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These statements focus on: 

1. **Grid Organization** - Multi-dimensional grid structure for spatial locality
2. **Memory Coalescing** - Contiguous memory access patterns via spatial grouping
3. **Indexing Efficiency** - Direct use of block/thread indices over complex unraveling
4. **Cache Utilization** - Memory-aligned tensor access patterns
5. **Register Efficiency** - Reduced arithmetic operations for index calculation

These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
