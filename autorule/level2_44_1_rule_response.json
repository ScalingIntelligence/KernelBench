  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels and trying to figure out why one is faster than the other. The main points highlighted in the reasoning are about the order of operations, specifically when the multiplication by a scalar (multiplier) happens.\n\nIn Kernel 1, each element is multiplied by the multiplier before being summed. This means for every element in the H\u00d7W spatial dimensions, there's a multiplication and an addition. So, for each channel, that's O(H\u00d7W) multiplications and O(H\u00d7W) additions.\n\nIn Kernel 2, the elements are summed first, and then the mean (sum divided by H\u00d7W) is multiplied by the multiplier. This approach reduces the number of multiplications to just one per channel, after the summation. So, it's O(H\u00d7W) additions and one multiplication per channel.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that by moving the multiplication outside the summation loop, Kernel 2 significantly reduces the number of multiplication operations. This is especially impactful when H and W are large, leading to fewer arithmetic operations overall. \n\nThe reasoning also mentions that other factors like memory access patterns, grid/block configurations, and shared memory usage are similar between the two kernels, so those aren't the differentiating factors. The main difference is the order of operations, which reduces computational workload.\n\nSo, the rule-like statements should capture this optimization strategy. The first rule would be about moving scalar multiplications outside of reduction loops to minimize operations. The second rule is about reducing arithmetic intensity by decreasing the number of operations, which is a general principle in optimizing CUDA kernels.\n",
