REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses shared memory to cache data reused across all threads in the block, reducing global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel loads reused data into shared memory once per block instead of per thread, amortizing global memory access costs.",
    "The kernel employs vectorized memory operations (e.g., float4) to improve global memory access efficiency.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory coalescing by accessing contiguous global memory locations during data loading into shared memory."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernels and focus on memory optimization strategies, such as shared memory caching, vectorized operations, and memory coalescing. The block size difference, while mentioned in the reasoning, is not included as a rule because its impact is context-dependent and not universally deterministic. The selected rules emphasize objective, deterministic optimizations applicable across various kernels.
