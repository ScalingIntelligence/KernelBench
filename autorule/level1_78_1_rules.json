  "The kernel uses fixed kernel dimensions allowing loop unrolling for reduced loop control overhead.",
  "The kernel avoids grid-stride loops by assigning one output element per thread, eliminating loop setup overhead.",
  "The kernel leverages compile-time constants for index calculations to enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel is specialized for specific parameters (e.g., stride, padding) enabling constant propagation.",
  "The kernel omits conditional branches (e.g., bias checks) to reduce thread divergence and instruction count."
