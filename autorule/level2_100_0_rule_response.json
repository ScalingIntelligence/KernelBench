  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be objective, deterministic, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 1 uses vectorized memory access with float4, processing four elements per transaction. This reduces global memory accesses. So a rule here would be about using vectorized memory access to reduce global memory transactions.\n\nNext, Kernel 1 replaces division with multiplication by precomputing the inverse. The rule here is replacing division operations with precomputed multiplications, which is a common optimization.\n\nThen, the reasoning points out that Kernel 1 processes multiple elements per thread (VEC_SIZE of 4), increasing work per thread. This relates to a rule about increasing elements per thread to improve arithmetic intensity and hide latency.\n\nKernel 1 also uses loop unrolling via #pragma unroll, which reduces loop overhead. So a rule about loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism.\n\nGrid configuration is another point. Kernel 1 calculates grid size based on the GPU's multiprocessor count and a multiple (like 32), optimizing occupancy. The rule here is adjusting grid size according to GPU properties for better utilization.\n\nBoundary handling in Kernel 1 allows coalesced memory access even in edge cases, leading to a rule about optimizing boundary conditions for coalesced memory access.\n\nAdditionally, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 1's thread block sizes are multiples of warp size (32) for better occupancy. Wait, looking back, the grid size calculation uses prop.multiProcessorCount * 32, but the example given in the user's examples includes thread block sizes as multiples of warp size. The reasoning does mention that Kernel 1's grid size is a multiple of SMs multiplied by 32, but the actual thread block size might be a different factor. However, the example rule is about thread block sizes, so if the reasoning mentions that, it should be included. Wait, in the reasoning under grid configuration, it says \"prop.multiProcessorCount * 32 blocks\", which refers to the number of blocks, not the block size. The thread block size (block_size) might be another factor. Let me check the original reasoning again.\n\nLooking back: \"Kernel 1 calculates the number of blocks based on the vector size and optimizes it according to the GPU's multiprocessor count. By using a grid size that's a multiple of the number of SMs multiplied by 32...\". So the grid size is adjusted, but the block size (threads per block) might be set to a multiple of 32. Wait, the example given by the user includes \"thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32)\". The reasoning might not explicitly state that the block size is a multiple of 32, but in the grid configuration, it's mentioned as a heuristic. However, the reasoning does not explicitly state that the thread block size is a multiple of 32. So maybe that's not a rule here. Alternatively, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 1's grid size is a multiple of SMs * 32, which is a different aspect. So perhaps the rule here is about grid size configuration based on the GPU's multiprocessor count and warp size.\n\nBut the example given by the user (Example 3) is about thread block sizes. The reasoning here doesn't explicitly mention thread block size being a multiple of 32, but the grid size calculation uses 32 as a factor. However, the key point in the reasoning is that Kernel 1's grid size is optimized for the GPU's SMs and uses 32 as a multiplier. So the rule here would be about grid size configuration, not thread block size. Therefore, a possible rule is \"The kernel configures grid size as a multiple of the number of SMs multiplied by 32 to optimize occupancy.\"\n\nAnother point is the use of shared memory tiling. Wait, the reasoning doesn't mention shared memory usage. The example given in the user's examples includes shared memory tiling, but in the provided reasoning, the optimizations are about vectorization, arithmetic replacement, grid configuration, etc. So shared memory isn't a factor here.\n\nPutting it all together, the rules extracted would be:\n\n1. The kernel uses vectorized memory access to reduce global memory transactions.\n2. The kernel replaces division operations with precomputed multiplications.\n3. The kernel processes multiple elements per thread to increase arithmetic intensity and hide latency.\n4. The kernel unrolls loops to reduce overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.\n5. The kernel configures grid size based on the GPU's multiprocessor count and a multiple of warp size for better occupancy.\n6. The kernel handles boundary conditions to maintain coalesced memory access patterns.\n\nEach of these is a general, objective rule applicable to CUDA kernels. Now, I need to check if all these are indeed mentioned in the reasoning and phrased as rules.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Vectorized memory access: Yes, mentioned as using float4 for vectorized loads/stores.\n- Division replaced with multiplication: Yes, precomputing inverse.\n- Multiple elements per thread: Yes, VEC_SIZE=4.\n- Loop unrolling: Yes, via #pragma unroll.\n- Grid configuration: Yes, using prop.multiProcessorCount *32.\n- Boundary handling for coalesced access: Yes, even in boundary cases.\n\nSo these six rules are valid. Now, format them as a JSON array of strings.\n",
