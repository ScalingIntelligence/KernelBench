REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a memory access pattern where consecutive threads in a warp access consecutive memory addresses within each loop iteration, ensuring coalesced memory transactions.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory access patterns across threads in a warp, which can lead to non-coalesced memory transactions and reduced bandwidth utilization.",
    "The kernel structures loops to process contiguous memory blocks per iteration within a warp, optimizing memory throughput."

ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 2's performance advantage stems from its memory access pattern, which ensures coalesced memory transactions by having consecutive threads access consecutive addresses within each loop iteration. This contrasts with Kernel 1's strided access pattern, which leads to non-coalesced transactions. The derived rules capture these insights in a generalizable manner, focusing on memory access patterns, avoidance of strides, and loop structuring for contiguous access. These rules are objective and applicable to other CUDA kernels.
