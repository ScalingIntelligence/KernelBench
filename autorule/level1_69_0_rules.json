  "The kernel uses read-only data cache (__ldg()) for accessing input and weight tensors.",
  "The kernel orders loops to prioritize input channel iterations (ic) after spatial dimensions (kh, kw) for coalesced input access in NCHW layout.",
  "The kernel applies the __restrict__ qualifier to pointers to enable compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel compiles with --use_fast_math to enable faster mathematical operations at the expense of some precision.",
  "The kernel optimizes loop order to access weight tensor elements contiguously across kernel dimensions (kh, kw) after input channels (ic)."
