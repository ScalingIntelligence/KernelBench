  "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel enables compiler optimizations such as -O2 and --use_fast_math for aggressive code optimization.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., 1024 threads per block).",
  "The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing."
