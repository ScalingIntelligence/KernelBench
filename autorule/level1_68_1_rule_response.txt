REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel orders loops such that validity checks for kernel positions are performed before iterating over input channels, reducing redundant checks and iterations.",
    "The kernel minimizes the number of validity checks by checking kernel positions once per output element rather than per input channel and kernel position.",
    "The kernel reduces the number of operations by skipping entire input channel loops when kernel positions are invalid."
]


ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 1's loop structure allows it to check kernel validity once per kernel position, skipping entire input channel loops when invalid. This reduces redundant checks and operations compared to Kernel 2, which checks validity per input channel and kernel position. The extracted rules reflect this structural optimization, focusing on loop order, validity check efficiency, and operation reduction.

Usage:
{'inputTokens': 8571, 'outputTokens': 154, 'totalTokens': 8725}
