  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants general CUDA optimization rules that are objective and deterministic.\n\nFirst, the shared memory usage in Kernel 2 is mentioned. The rule here would be about using shared memory to reduce global memory access, specifically for weights. So: \"The kernel uses shared memory to cache weights and reduce global memory access.\"\n\nNext, coalesced memory access. The reasoning says Kernel 2 processes consecutive positions, leading to coalesced accesses. So: \"The kernel processes consecutive memory positions with adjacent threads to enable coalesced global memory accesses.\"\n\n__restrict__ qualifiers and __ldg() are used. These are specific optimizations. So two rules: \"The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.\" and \"The kernel uses __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data access to leverage texture cache.\"\n\nBlock configuration: Larger block size (512) and looping. The rule here is about block size and loops: \"The kernel uses larger thread block sizes combined with loop unrolling to increase parallelism and hide memory latency.\"\n\nBias handling: Moving it outside the kernel. So: \"The kernel separates bias addition from the main computation to avoid conditional branching within the loop.\"\n\nGrid strategy: 1D grid vs 3D. The rule would be about grid dimensions: \"The kernel uses a 1D grid layout to improve memory access patterns compared to higher-dimensional grids.\"\n\nCompiler flags: Using -use_fast_math. So: \"The kernel enables compiler flags like -use_fast_math for faster mathematical operations at the expense of some precision.\"\n\nI need to check if these are all objective and applicable generally. Each statement is a specific optimization technique that can be applied to other kernels. They don't reference specific variables from the example, so they're general enough. Also, things like shared memory for weights, restrict qualifiers, coalesced access, etc., are all standard practices. The rules are all actionable and can be checked in code.\n",
