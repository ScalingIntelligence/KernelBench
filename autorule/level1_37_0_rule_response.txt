### Key Observations:
1. **Vectorization** is explicitly generalized as a rule for memory operations.
2. **Reduction strategies** are framed hierarchically with warp/block-level optimizations.
3. **Atomic operation avoidance** is stated as a distinct optimization principle.
4. **Block size selection** is tied to occupancy and resource usage (shared memory/warp alignment).
5. **Precision control** is highlighted as a performance factor.
6. **Synchronization minimization** is abstracted into a general rule.
7. **Grid configuration** best practices are included as device-aware clamping.
8. **Warp-centric operations** are explicitly called out as a distinct optimization technique.

These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization across various domains.
