  "response": "\n\nThe reasoning identifies that Kernel 2's in-place operation reduces memory bandwidth by avoiding separate input/output tensors. It also highlights simpler boundary checks (single conditional for vector access) and a loop-based approach for leftover elements. Additionally, direct pointer arithmetic in Kernel 2 may improve cache usage. These observations are distilled into generalizable rules about in-place operations, boundary checks, leftover handling, and memory access patterns.",
