These statements focus on how compile-time constants, parameter handling, and compiler optimizations impact kernel efficiency. They are general enough to apply to other CUDA kernels and emphasize the benefits of hardcoding constants for optimization opportunities, reduced register pressure, and efficient instruction generation.",
