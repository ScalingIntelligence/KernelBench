These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and include:  \n1. **Vectorized memory accesses** to reduce global memory transactions.  \n2. **1D grid configuration** with warp-aligned block sizes for better occupancy.  \n3. **Loop unrolling** to minimize overhead.  \n4. **Memory coalescing** via thread index organization.  \n5. **Use of `__restrict__`** for compiler optimizations.  \n\nEach rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.",
