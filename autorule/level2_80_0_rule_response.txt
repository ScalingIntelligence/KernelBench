    "The kernel avoids redundant memory initialization by using uninitialized memory for output when all elements will be overwritten.",
    "The kernel omits unnecessary bounds checks when grid dimensions are guaranteed to match data dimensions.",
    "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3) for CUDA code."
