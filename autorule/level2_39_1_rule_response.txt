REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids using __ldg for read-only data access when the memory access pattern does not benefit from texture cache spatial locality.",
    "The kernel uses a loop unroll factor that balances instruction-level parallelism with register pressure to avoid spills and maintain occupancy.",
    "The kernel omits __launch_bounds__ directives to allow the compiler more flexibility in register allocation and optimization.",
    "The kernel prioritizes L1/L2 cache usage over texture cache for strided memory access patterns to improve global memory access efficiency."

ANSWER:


The JSON array lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement captures a general optimization principle applicable to CUDA kernels, such as avoiding `__ldg` when texture cache benefits are absent, balancing loop unrolling to manage register pressure, omitting restrictive directives for compiler flexibility, and prioritizing L1/L2 caches for strided accesses. These rules are objective and can be deterministically applied or evaluated across different kernels.
