REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids division and modulus operations in index calculations by using linear offsets.",
    "The kernel includes a secondary loop to process remaining elements when the total number of elements is not a multiple of the vector size.",
    "The kernel uses contiguous memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory reads.",
    "The kernel is compiled with optimization flags (-O3) enabling aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel is compiled with fast math flags (-use_fast_math) to use approximate but faster mathematical operations.",
    "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous before processing to guarantee optimal memory layout."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These include avoiding division/modulus in indexing, handling partial elements, contiguous memory access, compiler optimizations, fast math flags, and ensuring input tensor contiguity. Each statement is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels generally.
