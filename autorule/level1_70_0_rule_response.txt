REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel reorders loops to place channel iteration outside spatial kernel loops for better memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel precomputes base indices outside inner loops to reduce redundant calculations.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of 32 (e.g., 512) for better GPU occupancy.",
    "The kernel precomputes validity flags once per iteration to avoid redundant conditional checks.",
    "The kernel groups channel iterations to improve spatial locality and cache hit rates."
