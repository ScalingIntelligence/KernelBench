REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses block-level shared memory reduction to minimize the number of atomic operations.",
    "The kernel uses a block size that reduces the total number of blocks, thereby decreasing atomic operation frequency.",
    "The kernel avoids per-warp atomic additions by aggregating results at the block level before a single atomic update.",
    "The kernel employs a grid-stride loop structure with fewer iterations for handling remainder elements compared to separate grid-stride remainder loops.",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that align with vectorized memory access patterns (e.g., multiples of 4 for float4 operations)."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided includes rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. These statements are generalized to apply to CUDA kernels beyond the specific example discussed. They focus on atomic operation efficiency, reduction strategies, grid/block configuration, and memory access patterns, all of which are critical factors in kernel performance. Each statement is designed to be objectively verifiable and deterministic when analyzing or comparing CUDA kernels.
