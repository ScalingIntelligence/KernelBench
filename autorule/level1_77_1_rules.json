  "The kernel moves bias addition outside of the main computation loop to leverage optimized vector operations.",
  "The kernel checks validity conditions (e.g., modulo operations) early in loop iterations to skip invalid computations sooner.",
  "The kernel avoids conditional branches for optional operations (e.g., bias addition) within the main computation loop.",
  "The kernel enforces tensor contiguity to ensure optimal memory access patterns during execution.",
  "The kernel uses separate post-processing steps (e.g., bias addition) instead of fused conditional operations within the core kernel."
