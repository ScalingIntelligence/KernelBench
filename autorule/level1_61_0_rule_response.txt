REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel assigns one thread per output element to maximize parallelism.",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 256 threads) to achieve higher GPU occupancy.",
    "The kernel employs a 1D grid configuration to ensure efficient coverage of output elements and minimize wasted threads.",
    "The kernel avoids nested loops over output channels within individual threads to reduce per-thread workload and control flow complexity.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns to enable coalesced global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel minimizes divergent branching within warps by structuring threads to follow similar code paths for adjacent outputs."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. Each statement addresses a specific optimization strategy that differentiates the faster kernel (Kernel 1) from the slower one (Kernel 2). These rules focus on thread granularity, block configuration, memory access patterns, control flow efficiency, and grid utilization. They are formulated to be generalizable and applicable to various CUDA kernels, emphasizing principles like maximizing parallelism, optimizing occupancy, ensuring coalesced memory access, and minimizing divergence.
