REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations.",
    "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enable compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel minimizes global memory traffic by keeping intermediate results in registers.",
    "The kernel uses boundary checks that are statically analyzable and less divergent.",
    "The kernel avoids framework overhead by implementing operations in a custom kernel rather than using multiple framework-provided operations."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. Each statement captures a general principle that can be applied to evaluate CUDA kernel optimizations. The rules focus on fusion, loop unrolling, memory efficiency, boundary handling, and framework overhead avoidance, all of which are objective and deterministic factors influencing kernel performance.
