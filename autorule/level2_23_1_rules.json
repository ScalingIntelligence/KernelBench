  "The kernel flattens multiple spatial dimensions into a single dimension to enable contiguous memory access.",
  "The kernel minimizes the number of division and modulo operations for index calculations.",
  "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads per block) to improve SM occupancy.",
  "The kernel reduces the number of parameters passed to decrease register pressure.",
  "The kernel precomputes combined dimensions (e.g., DHW) to avoid redundant calculations during index computation."
