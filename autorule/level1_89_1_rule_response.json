  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array captures the key optimizations from the reasoning as rule-like statements. Each statement is derived from specific observations in Kernel 2's implementation compared to Kernel 1. For instance, vectorized memory access (float4) directly addresses improved memory efficiency, while hierarchical scanning and reduced boundary checks highlight structural and conditional optimizations. The rules are generalized to apply beyond the specific example, focusing on CUDA best practices like memory coalescing, register usage, shared memory efficiency, and parallelism strategies.",
