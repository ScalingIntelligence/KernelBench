REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel fuses element-wise operations (e.g., Add) with normalization operations (e.g., LayerNorm) into a single kernel.",
    "The kernel uses shared memory and block-level parallel reductions for efficient computation of statistics (e.g., mean, variance).",
    "The kernel accesses contiguous memory regions along a specific dimension (e.g., W) to enable coalesced global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel minimizes complex index calculations (e.g., modulo/division operations) by directly mapping thread/block indices to problem dimensions.",
    "The kernel delegates compute-heavy operations (e.g., AvgPool, GELU) to highly optimized library implementations (e.g., cuDNN/cuBLAS) instead of custom implementations.",
    "The kernel avoids strided or scattered memory access patterns (e.g., non-coalesced accesses from 2x2x2 windows) that reduce memory throughput.",
    "The kernel uses thread block configurations that align with the problem's dimensionality (e.g., threads per block matching the W dimension) for efficient reductions."
