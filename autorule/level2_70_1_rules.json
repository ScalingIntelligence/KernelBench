  "The kernel uses in-place operations to avoid memory allocation overhead.",
  "The kernel uses a larger block size (1024 threads) to maximize thread utilization per block and improve memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel avoids warp divergence by processing elements without tail handling loops or conditional branches for vectorized access.",
  "The kernel minimizes register usage by simplifying code, allowing higher occupancy and more active warps.",
  "The kernel ensures contiguous memory access patterns without requiring vectorized loads/stores, reducing complexity and potential overhead."
