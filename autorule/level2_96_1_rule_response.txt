REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a 2D grid configuration to improve block scheduling and resource utilization.",
    "The kernel precomputes base pointers for batch and channel data to reduce redundant address calculations in inner loops.",
    "The kernel avoids division and modulus operations for batch/channel indexing by directly using blockIdx.x and blockIdx.y.",
    "The kernel structures memory accesses to ensure contiguous reads within warps for better coalescing."
