  "The kernel uses vectorized memory loads/stores (e.g., float4) to reduce memory transactions",
  "The kernel utilizes warp shuffle instructions (__shfl_down_sync) for reductions instead of shared memory",
  "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage by only storing partial sums per warp rather than per thread",
  "The kernel employs fast math operations (e.g., rsqrt) with --use_fast_math compiler flags",
  "The kernel structures loops to process multiple elements per iteration via vectorization",
  "The kernel separates reduction operations into warp-level and cross-warp phases",
  "The kernel uses 128-bit memory transactions to align with CUDA coalescing requirements"
