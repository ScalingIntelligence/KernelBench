    "The kernel uses the __ldg intrinsic to leverage the read-only data cache for memory access.",
    "The kernel is compiled with the -use_fast_math flag to enable faster approximate math operations and aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel accesses memory in a pattern that benefits from hardware-level caching for scattered reads.",
