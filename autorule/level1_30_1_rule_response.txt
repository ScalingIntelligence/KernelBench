REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to extract rule-like statements from the reasoning provided. The reasoning compares two CUDA kernels and explains why one is faster. The main points mentioned are about compiler flags, contiguous memory checks, and fast math optimizations.

First, the compiler flags: Kernel 2 uses "-O3" and "--use_fast_math". These are specific optimizations that can be applied generally. So a rule here would be about enabling higher optimization levels and fast math flags.

Next, the contiguous memory check in Kernel 2. The reasoning says this ensures optimal memory access patterns. So a rule could be about checking for contiguous tensors to improve memory access.

Then, the use of fast math leading to fused operations and approximations. That's another general practice, so a rule about using fast math to enable those optimizations.

I need to make sure these rules are general and applicable to various CUDA kernels, not just this specific case. Let me check the examples given. The examples include things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, and thread block sizes. The rules I extract should be similar in generality.

Looking at the reasoning, the key points are:

1. Using -O3 and --use_fast_math in compiler flags.
2. Checking for contiguous tensors to ensure optimal memory access.
3. Fast math enabling FMA and approximate operations.

So translating these into rule-like statements:

- The kernel is compiled with the -O3 optimization level.
- The kernel is compiled with --use_fast_math to enable faster approximate math operations.
- The kernel enforces contiguous memory access for input tensors.
- The kernel uses compiler flags that enable fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions.
- The kernel uses compiler flags that reduce precision for reciprocal and division operations.

Wait, but the last two points are actually results of using --use_fast_math. The original reasoning mentions that --use_fast_math enables those optimizations. So maybe the more general rule is about using --use_fast_math, which encompasses those effects. The specific effects like FMA might be too detailed, but the user's examples include things like "uses shared memory tiling", which is a specific technique. Hmm.

The example rules are more about the technique applied rather than the compiler flags. But the reasoning here is focused on compiler optimizations. The user's instruction says to extract rule-like statements implied by the reasoning. So even if the rules are about compiler flags, they should be included as they are general for CUDA kernels.

So the rules would be:

1. The kernel is compiled with the -O3 optimization level.
2. The kernel is compiled with the --use_fast_math flag to enable faster approximate math operations.
3. The kernel enforces contiguous memory access for input tensors to ensure optimal memory access patterns.

Are these objectively judgeable? Yes. You can check the compiler flags and the presence of contiguous checks.

The reasoning also mentions that Kernel 2 uses TORCH_CHECK for contiguous, which enforces it. So that's a specific, checkable rule.

I think those three points are the main ones. The other points about FMA and reduced precision are results of --use_fast_math, so they're covered under the second rule. Including them as separate rules might be redundant.

So the final list should include the three rules mentioned.
