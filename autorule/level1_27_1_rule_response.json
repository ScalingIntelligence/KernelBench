  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels for the SELU activation function and trying to determine why one is faster. The key points mentioned are the use of the --use_fast_math compiler flag, declaring constants inside the active thread block to reduce register pressure, and fusing the scale multiplication.\n\nFirst, the --use_fast_math flag is a clear optimization. This flag allows the compiler to use faster, less precise math functions, which is especially beneficial for operations like expf. This is a general CUDA optimization technique applicable to any kernel using transcendental functions.\n\nNext, the placement of constant declarations. In Kernel 2, alpha and scale are declared inside the if block that checks if the thread is active. This means inactive threads don't allocate registers for these constants, reducing register usage. Lower register pressure can lead to higher occupancy, which is a well-known optimization strategy in CUDA. This is a general rule because managing register usage by scoping variables appropriately can be applied to various kernels.\n\nThe third point about fusing the scale multiplication is mentioned, but the reasoning also notes that the compiler might optimize this regardless. However, the explicit factoring could help the compiler, so it's a potential rule. But the example given in the reasoning (Example 1) refers to operator fusion between multiple operations, which is a bit different. The user's case is more about code structure to allow compiler optimizations, which might not be a direct rule. However, the reasoning emphasizes that this can help, so it's included as a possible rule.\n\nNow, checking the examples given earlier: operator fusion, shared memory tiling, and thread block sizes. The rules extracted should be similar in generality. The --use_fast_math and register pressure via variable scoping fit as general rules. The fused multiplication might be a stretch, but since the reasoning highlights it as a factor, it's included as a third rule.\n\nSo, compiling these into rule-like statements:\n\n1. The kernel uses the --use_fast_math compiler flag to enable faster approximate math functions.\n2. The kernel declares constants within the active thread block to reduce register pressure.\n3. The kernel fuses scalar multiplications to minimize redundant arithmetic operations.\n\nThese are objective and can be checked by looking at the compiler flags and code structure. The third point is a bit more specific but still general enough for other kernels.\n",
