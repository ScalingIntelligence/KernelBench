REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses the exact GELU implementation with erff instead of an approximate version requiring more arithmetic operations.",
    "The kernel avoids vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce register pressure and improve GPU occupancy.",
    "The kernel processes one element per thread to minimize register usage and enable higher parallelism.",
    "The kernel uses hardware-optimized mathematical functions (e.g., erff, expf) for critical operations.",
    "The kernel maintains simpler per-thread operations to allow better compiler optimizations and instruction scheduling."
