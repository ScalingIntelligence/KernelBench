  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement captures a general optimization principle applicable to CUDA kernels, such as avoiding `__ldg` when texture cache benefits are absent, balancing loop unrolling to manage register pressure, omitting restrictive directives for compiler flexibility, and prioritizing L1/L2 caches for strided accesses. These rules are objective and can be deterministically applied or evaluated across different kernels.",
