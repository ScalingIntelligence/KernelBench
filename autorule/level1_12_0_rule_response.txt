REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration to maximize parallelism and GPU utilization.",
    "The kernel avoids shared memory synchronization overhead by directly accessing global memory with cache-friendly patterns.",
    "The kernel ensures coalesced global memory access for input data by mapping consecutive threads to contiguous memory elements.",
    "The kernel minimizes branch divergence by avoiding conditional checks for edge cases within loops.",
    "The kernel uses a simpler code structure with fewer registers, allowing higher thread occupancy.",
    "The kernel processes elements without requiring data alignment for vectorized memory access.",
    "The kernel distributes work evenly across all threads to prevent underutilization."
