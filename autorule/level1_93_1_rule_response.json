These statements focus on observable implementation differences related to: \n\n1. **Vectorization strategy** - Direct component access vs bitwise extraction\n2. **Tensor dimension flexibility** - Support for arbitrary shapes vs hardcoded constraints\n3. **Memory layout handling** - Graceful fallback to non-vectorized paths\n4. **Input requirements** - Avoiding divisibility constraints\n\nThese rules can be objectively verified by inspecting kernel code for: \n- Use of vector data types vs bitwise operations\n- Presence of dimension checks/constraints\n- Conditional handling of edge cases\n- Support for stride parameters vs fixed indexing",
