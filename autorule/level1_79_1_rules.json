  "The kernel moves bias addition outside of the CUDA kernel to leverage optimized PyTorch operations.",
  "The kernel orders loops with kernel elements (k) as the outer loop and input channels (in_chan) as the inner loop to enable contiguous memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel checks validity of kernel positions (k) before iterating over input channels to skip unnecessary computations.",
  "The kernel avoids branching within the main computation loop by handling bias externally.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory coalescing by structuring loops to access consecutive input channels sequentially."
