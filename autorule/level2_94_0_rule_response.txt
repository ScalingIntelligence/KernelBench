REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions.",
    "The kernel employs warp-level reductions using shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_sync) instead of shared memory for sum/mean calculations.",
    "The kernel configures thread block sizes to maximize occupancy (e.g., 512 threads per block) based on GPU architecture limits.",
    "The kernel avoids shared memory usage in reduction operations to eliminate synchronization and bank conflict overhead.",
    "The kernel aligns grid dimensions with data structure dimensions (e.g., 2D grid for batch × groups) to simplify indexing and improve memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread via loop unrolling or vectorization to improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel uses compiler flags (e.g., --use_fast_math) to enable optimized mathematical approximations for faster computation."
