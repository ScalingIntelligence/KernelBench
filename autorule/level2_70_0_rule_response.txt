REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids vectorized memory accesses which can cause misalignment and require scalar fallback handling.",
    "The kernel uses a per-thread processing strategy that reduces register pressure, enabling higher occupancy.",
    "The kernel processes elements without requiring alignment constraints, ensuring consistent memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel minimizes tail effects by processing elements individually, avoiding underutilized threads from residual elements."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules focus on the trade-offs between vectorization strategies, register usage, memory alignment, and tail effect handling. They are general enough to apply to other CUDA kernels and can be objectively verified through metrics like occupancy calculators, alignment checks, or profiling tools.
