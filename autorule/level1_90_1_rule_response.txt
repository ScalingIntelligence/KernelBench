REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory stores (e.g., float4) to reduce the number of store operations and improve memory throughput.",
    "The kernel employs a loop structure that minimizes register pressure, allowing higher GPU occupancy through increased concurrent threads.",
    "The kernel handles remaining elements (tail) with unrolled loops and minimal branching to reduce control flow overhead.",
    "The kernel simplifies control flow by using fewer loop stages, reducing instruction cache pressure and improving warp scheduling efficiency.",
    "The kernel maximizes memory transaction width by using vectorized stores (e.g., 128-bit transactions) instead of smaller scalar writes."
