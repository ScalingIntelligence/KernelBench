REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel separates vectorized processing and remainder handling into distinct loops to avoid branch divergence in the main loop.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable better compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
    "The kernel focuses __ldg (texture cache) usage on frequently reused data (e.g., vector B) while avoiding it for per-thread unique data (e.g., matrix A).",
    "The kernel avoids conditional checks for vector alignment within the main processing loop to improve instruction pipelining efficiency.",
    "The kernel handles remainder elements in a separate loop after processing aligned vector loads to minimize warp divergence."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the analysis of the two CUDA kernels. These rules highlight critical optimizations such as avoiding branch divergence through loop separation, strategic use of memory qualifiers (`__restrict__`, `__ldg`), and minimizing warp divergence via remainder handling. The rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to general CUDA optimization strategies.
