These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernels and focus on optimizations such as vectorized memory operations, register blocking, thread configuration for occupancy, memory coalescing, loop unrolling, and efficient boundary handling. Each statement is objective and can be applied to evaluate or design other CUDA kernels.",
