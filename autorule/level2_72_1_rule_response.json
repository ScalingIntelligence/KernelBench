  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These statements are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels in general. They focus on the use of `__restrict__` for aliasing guarantees, elimination of redundant boundary checks under specific input conditions, and compile-time arithmetic optimizations.",
  "reasoning_trace": "[\n    \"The kernel uses the __restrict__ qualifier on input and output pointers to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.\",\n    \"The kernel omits redundant boundary checks when input dimensions are known to be multiples of the tiling factor, reducing branch instructions.\",\n    \"The kernel leverages compile-time constant division optimization by converting division into multiplication with a precomputed reciprocal where the divisor is a known constant.\"\n]\n",
