REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels and trying to determine why one is faster than the other. The main points highlighted are the compiler flags used. 

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 1 uses the flags "-O3" and "--use_fast_math", while Kernel 2 does not. The explanation points out that these flags enable more aggressive optimizations and faster math operations. 

The key here is to extract rule-like statements from this reasoning. The user provided examples like operator fusion or using shared memory tiling. So, the rules should be generalizable to other CUDA kernels, not specific to this case.

Looking at the compiler flags, "-O3" is a general optimization level. So a rule could be about using higher optimization levels. Similarly, "--use_fast_math" is a flag that enables faster math operations by relaxing precision. That's another general rule.

The reasoning also mentions that without these flags, the compiler might default to lower optimizations. But the rules should focus on the presence of certain optimizations rather than the absence. So the rules would be about the use of specific compiler flags that enhance performance.

Other possible factors like block configuration were considered but dismissed because both kernels used the same setup. So those aren't part of the rules here.

Therefore, the rule-like statements would be about enabling high optimization levels and using fast math flags. These are general and can be applied to any CUDA kernel compilation.


ANSWER:


[
    "- The kernel is compiled with high optimization levels (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and vectorization.",
    "- The kernel uses fast math compiler flags (e.g., --use_fast_math) to prioritize computational speed over strict IEEE-754 precision."
