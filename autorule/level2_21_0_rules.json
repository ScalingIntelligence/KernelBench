  "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop pattern to process multiple elements per thread, improving GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel uses fast math intrinsics (e.g., __expf) and is compiled with -use_fast_math for approximate but faster computations.",
  "The kernel caps the maximum number of blocks to prevent oversubscription and improve SM occupancy.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable compiler optimizations by guaranteeing no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to optimize memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel avoids per-thread boundary checks by using a grid-stride loop, reducing branch divergence."
