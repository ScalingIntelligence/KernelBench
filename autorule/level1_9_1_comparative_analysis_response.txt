REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out why Kernel 2 is faster than Kernel 1. Both are CUDA matrix multiplication kernels. Let me start by understanding what each kernel does.

Kernel 1 looks like a straightforward matrix multiplication. Each thread computes a single element of the output matrix C by looping over the K dimension. The threads are organized in 16x16 blocks. So for each element C[row][col], the thread does a loop from k=0 to K-1, adding A[row][k] * B[k][col]. That's the naive approach. The problem with this is that each thread is accessing global memory for every element of A and B. Since global memory accesses are slow, this can lead to a lot of latency. Also, since adjacent threads are accessing elements in a row-major order, maybe there's no coalescing here. For example, when accessing A[row*K +k], consecutive threads (same row, different columns) would access consecutive elements in A's row, which is good for coalescing. But when accessing B[k*N +col], consecutive threads (same row in block) would be accessing elements in B that are spaced by N elements. Since N could be large, this would lead to non-coalesced accesses, which are inefficient. So the naive kernel probably has poor memory access patterns, leading to high latency and underutilized memory bandwidth.

Now Kernel 2 uses tiling with shared memory. The key here is that they load tiles of A and B into shared memory, which is much faster. The code uses shared memory arrays As and Bs of size TILE_SIZE x TILE_SIZE (16x16). The kernel breaks the K dimension into tiles of size TILE_SIZE. For each tile, each thread loads a part of the A and B tiles into shared memory. Then, after a __syncthreads(), the threads compute the partial sum for that tile by multiplying the shared memory values. This way, each element from A and B is loaded into shared memory once and reused multiple times. For example, a tile from A is reused for all the columns in the B tile, and vice versa. This reduces the number of global memory accesses because data is reused from shared memory.

In the tiled version, when loading data into shared memory, the accesses to global memory can be coalesced. For instance, when loading a tile of A, each thread in the block loads a contiguous element from global memory into shared memory. Since the threads in a warp access consecutive memory addresses, this allows for coalesced reads, which are much more efficient. Similarly for B. Then, when performing the computation, the shared memory accesses are within the tile, which is faster and has higher bandwidth than global memory.

Another point is that in the tiled kernel, the loop over k_block allows for reusing the loaded tiles multiple times. Each tile of A and B is used for TILE_SIZE multiplies and adds. This reduces the total number of global memory accesses by a factor of TILE_SIZE. For example, if TILE_SIZE is 16, each element of A and B is loaded once from global memory and used 16 times (once per element in the tile). This significantly reduces the global memory bandwidth requirements, which is a major bottleneck in matrix multiplication.

Additionally, the shared memory approach allows for better utilization of the memory hierarchy. Since shared memory is on-chip and has much lower latency than global memory, the repeated accesses to As and Bs in the inner loop are much faster. This reduces the overall time spent waiting for memory accesses, allowing the compute units to be more efficiently utilized.

In the original kernel (Kernel 1), each thread performs K global memory reads (for A and B each) and writes once to C. In Kernel 2, each thread loads (K/TILE_SIZE) * TILE_SIZE elements from A and B (since each tile requires TILE_SIZE elements per thread, and there are K/TILE_SIZE tiles). Wait, no. Let me think again. For each tile, each thread loads one element from A and one from B. So for K elements, divided into TILE_SIZE chunks, there are K/TILE_SIZE iterations. Each iteration, each thread loads one element from A and one from B. So total global memory accesses per thread for A and B are 2*(K/TILE_SIZE). Then, each of those elements is used TILE_SIZE times (since in the inner loop over i from 0 to TILE_SIZE-1, each element from As is multiplied by each element from Bs). So the total number of global memory accesses is reduced by a factor of TILE_SIZE. For example, if TILE_SIZE is 16, then each element is loaded once and used 16 times. This reduces the global memory traffic by 16x, which is a huge improvement.

Therefore, the main reason Kernel 2 is faster is due to the use of shared memory tiling, which allows for data reuse and coalesced global memory accesses, significantly reducing the number of global memory transactions and improving memory bandwidth utilization. The naive kernel in Kernel 1 doesn't take advantage of shared memory, leading to inefficient global memory accesses and higher latency.


ANSWER:


The performance difference between the two CUDA kernels stems from their memory access patterns and utilization of shared memory:

1. **Global Memory Access Efficiency**:
   - **Kernel 1** uses a naive approach where each thread directly accesses global memory for every element of A and B. This results in:
     - *Non-coalesced accesses* for matrix B (strided accesses with stride N).
     - *No data reuse*; each element is loaded O(K) times from global memory.
   - **Kernel 2** employs tiling with shared memory (16x16 tiles), enabling:
     - *Coalesced global memory reads* when loading tiles into shared memory.
     - *Data reuse*; each loaded tile is used TILE_SIZE times, reducing global memory accesses by a factor of TILE_SIZE.

2. **Shared Memory Utilization**:
   - **Kernel 2** leverages fast on-chip shared memory for tile storage, reducing reliance on slow global memory. The tiled approach:
     - Allows 16x reuse of each loaded element (for TILE_SIZE=16).
     - Minimizes redundant global memory transactions via blocking.

3. **Thread Block Configuration**:
   - Both use 16x16 thread blocks, but **Kernel 2**'s tiling strategy better aligns with GPU memory hierarchy, improving effective bandwidth.

**Key Speedup Factors**:
- **~16x reduction** in global memory accesses (TILE_SIZE=16)
- **Coalesced memory patterns** in tile loading phase
- **Reduced memory latency** via shared memory reuse

This explains why Kernel 2 achieves a 37% speedup (24.8ms vs 37.5ms) - it better leverages GPU memory hierarchy through tiling and shared memory optimizations.
