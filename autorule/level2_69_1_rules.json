  "The kernel uses a positive conditional check (e.g., `if (idx < num_elements)`) to enable compiler optimizations like instruction predication, avoiding warp divergence.",
  "The kernel avoids early returns (e.g., `if (idx >= num_elements) return;`) to prevent control flow divergence within warps, ensuring unified execution paths.",
  "The kernel structures conditional execution to allow dead-code elimination for invalid threads, reducing register pressure and improving occupancy."
