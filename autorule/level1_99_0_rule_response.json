  "response": "\n\nThe two CUDA kernels provided are **identical** in their implementation. There is no discernible difference in the code structure, memory access patterns, thread configuration, or mathematical operations between Kernel 1 and Kernel 2. Both kernels:\n\n1. Use the same block size (`256`) and grid size calculation.\n2. Perform identical computations for `pos_dist`, `neg_dist`, and `loss`.\n3. Launch the kernel with the same parameters.\n4. Process input tensors of identical shape and data generation.\n\nThe observed runtime difference (0.0952 ms vs. 0.0944 ms) is **within the margin of measurement error** and likely due to external factors such as GPU state fluctuations, background processes, or non-deterministic CUDA optimizations during execution. For practical purposes, the kernels are performance-equivalent.",
