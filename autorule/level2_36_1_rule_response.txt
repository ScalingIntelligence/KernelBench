ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
    "The kernel separates compute-bound operations into distinct kernels for optimal parallelism.",
    "The kernel avoids thread underutilization by ensuring all threads in a block participate in computations.",
    "The kernel uses block sizes that maximize GPU occupancy rather than matching problem dimensions directly.",
    "The kernel performs reduction operations with larger thread blocks to increase parallelism during reduction steps."
]

These statements capture the key optimization principles observed in the comparison between Kernel 1 and Kernel 2, focusing on thread utilization, block sizing strategies, and operation separation for better GPU performance.
