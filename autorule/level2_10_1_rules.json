  "The kernel uses a 2D grid configuration to directly map block indices to problem dimensions, avoiding division and modulus operations.",
  "The kernel employs a strided loop structure in reduction operations to minimize warp divergence by reducing conditional checks within the loop body.",
  "The kernel avoids integer division and modulus operations for dimension indexing by leveraging grid and block organization."
