  "The kernel uses out-of-place memory operations to separate read and write memory regions.",
  "The kernel avoids in-place read-modify-write operations which can introduce memory access dependencies.",
  "The kernel compiles host-side code with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3) for improved performance.",
  "The kernel uses ternary operators for conditional operations instead of function calls like max()."
