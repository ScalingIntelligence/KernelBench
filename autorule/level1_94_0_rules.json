  "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions and improve coalescing.",
  "The kernel unrolls loops explicitly to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel calculates grid size to minimize the number of blocks, reducing atomic operations on global memory.",
  "The kernel processes remainder elements separately from vectorized data to minimize overhead.",
  "The kernel aligns memory access patterns with GPU coalescing rules to reduce wasted transactions."
