REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's parse through the reasoning provided to extract the rule-like statements. The user wants general, objective rules that can be applied to various CUDA kernels.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses a 2D grid structure which allows consecutive threads to access consecutive memory locations. This leads to better memory coalescing. So a rule here could be about using multidimensional thread grids to align with data layout for coalescing.

Next, the analysis points out that Kernel 2's linear index calculation aligns with row-major memory layouts, avoiding explicit stride checks. This implies a rule about implicit stride handling through index calculation to streamline execution.

Another point is the 2D block structure (16x16) matching multidimensional data, improving parallelism and reducing thread divergence. This suggests a rule about grid/block configuration matching data dimensions for better occupancy and reduced divergence.

The reasoning also notes that Kernel 2's access pattern has better spatial locality, leveraging cache lines. So a rule about optimizing for spatial locality to improve cache utilization.

Additionally, Kernel 1 uses vectorized loads but requires alignment, whereas Kernel 2's approach is more robust. However, the rules should focus on what Kernel 2 does right. The key difference is the memory coalescing due to thread arrangement, not necessarily vectorization.

Putting this together, the rules would be:

1. Using multidimensional thread grids to align with data layout for efficient memory coalescing.
2. Implicitly handling memory strides through index calculation to avoid branches and streamline execution.
3. Configuring grid and block dimensions to match data structure for improved parallelism and reduced thread divergence.
4. Optimizing memory access patterns for spatial locality to enhance cache utilization.

Each of these is a general, applicable rule that can be objectively assessed by looking at the kernel's grid structure, index calculations, and memory access patterns.
