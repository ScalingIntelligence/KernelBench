These statements focus on the computational efficiency of the GELU implementation, avoidance of complex arithmetic operations, reduction of high-latency functions, and optimization of register usage. Each statement is general enough to apply to various CUDA kernels and can be objectively assessed based on code structure and operation choices.",
