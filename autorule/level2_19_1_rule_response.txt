REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids redundant integer division and modulo operations in index calculation.",
    "The kernel uses direct index computation without decomposing variables into subcomponents when possible.",
    "The kernel reduces per-element arithmetic operations by eliminating unnecessary intermediate calculations."

ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 2 is faster because it optimizes index calculations by avoiding redundant operations. Specifically, Kernel 1 decomposes `hw` into `h` and `w` using division and modulo operations, then recomputes `h*W + w`, while Kernel 2 directly uses `hw` without splitting. This eliminates computationally expensive integer operations and reduces per-thread arithmetic overhead. The derived rules focus on avoiding redundant operations, simplifying index computation, and minimizing per-element calculations, which are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimizations.
