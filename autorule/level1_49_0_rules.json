  "The kernel ensures input tensor contiguity to enable coalesced memory access.",
  "The kernel avoids atomic operations by assigning each output element to a single thread.",
  "The kernel uses a grid layout with one thread per output element to maximize parallelism.",
  "The kernel accesses memory with sequential reads and optimal strides to leverage cache lines and memory bursts.",
  "The kernel minimizes control divergence by using uniform execution paths across threads.",
  "The kernel simplifies memory access patterns by reshaping the problem into outer and inner dimensions."
