REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel reduces global memory accesses by caching input values in local variables for reuse.",
    "The kernel uses const qualifiers to provide optimization hints to the compiler.",
    "The kernel minimizes redundant global memory reads by loading each input element once per thread."

ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 2 explicitly caches input values in registers, reducing global memory accesses from two to one per element. This is captured in the first and third rules. The use of `const` qualifiers in Kernel 2 is noted as a potential compiler optimization hint, forming the second rule. These rules are objective and applicable to CUDA kernels generally.
