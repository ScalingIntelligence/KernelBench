  "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop pattern to handle arbitrary input sizes and improve hardware utilization.",
  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ keyword on pointers to enable compiler optimizations by eliminating potential pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel uses fused math operations (e.g., fmaxf) instead of explicit branching to avoid warp divergence.",
  "The kernel is compiled with -use_fast_math to enable faster math optimizations at the cost of precision.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes optimized for occupancy (e.g., 512 threads per block).",
  "The kernel avoids forced loop unrolling to reduce register pressure and improve occupancy."
