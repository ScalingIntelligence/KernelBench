  "The kernel assigns each thread to process a single output element, maximizing parallelism.",
  "The kernel uses a 1D grid and block structure to better utilize GPU thread hierarchy and occupancy.",
  "The kernel minimizes nested loops over batches and channels within each thread to reduce serial processing.",
  "The kernel structures memory accesses to be contiguous across warps for coalesced global memory access.",
  "The kernel reduces register pressure and increases occupancy by limiting per-thread workload and loop complexity.",
  "The kernel leverages channel grouping to decrease the iteration range over input channels per thread.",
  "The kernel avoids processing multiple batches and output channels within a single thread to enhance parallelism."
