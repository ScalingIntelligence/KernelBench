REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's start by analyzing the reasoning provided. The user wants me to extract rule-like statements from the explanation of why Kernel 2 is faster than Kernel 1. The rules should be general, objective, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.

First, looking at the key points mentioned: loop unrolling, compiler optimizations, block size tuning, tile size alignment with warp size, and memory coalescing. 

The reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses loop unrolling by a factor of 4. This reduces loop overhead and improves instruction-level parallelism. So a rule here could be about loop unrolling to reduce control overhead.

Next, the compiler flags -O2 and --use_fast_math are used in Kernel 2. These enable aggressive optimizations and faster math operations. So a rule about enabling specific compiler optimizations would fit.

Block size: Kernel 2 uses 32x32 blocks (1024 threads), which is the maximum allowed. This improves occupancy. A rule here could be about using block sizes that maximize occupancy, possibly up to the hardware limit.

Tile size of 32 aligns with warp size (32 threads), which helps in memory coalescing. So a rule about aligning tile sizes with warp size for better memory access.

The reasoning also mentions that the larger block size leads to higher occupancy. So another rule could be about block size affecting occupancy and latency hiding.

Additionally, the use of fast math flags is a specific optimization, so that's another rule.

Now, I need to phrase these as general, objective rules. Let me check the examples given. The examples are things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, thread block multiples of warp size.

So possible rules from the reasoning:

1. The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
2. The kernel enables compiler optimizations such as -O2 and --use_fast_math for aggressive code optimization and faster mathematical operations.
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy, up to the hardware limit (e.g., 1024 threads per block).
4. The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing.
5. The kernel uses larger thread block sizes to increase occupancy and better hide memory latency.

Wait, but some of these might be overlapping. For example, points 3 and 5 both relate to block size and occupancy. Maybe consolidate. Also, the tile size alignment is specific to warp size, which is a general rule.

Another point from the reasoning: the TILE_SIZE=32 aligns with warp size, improving memory coalescing. So that's a separate rule.

The compiler flags are specific, but the general idea is enabling certain optimizations. So the rule would mention using those flags.

Loop unrolling is a general technique, so that's a valid rule.

So compiling all these, the JSON array should include:

- The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
- The kernel enables compiler optimizations such as -O2 and --use_fast_math.
- The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., up to 1024 threads per block).
- The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing.

Wait, but the example rules are more concise. For instance, "uses shared memory tiling" is a concise statement. The user's examples don't include explanations, just the rule. So perhaps the rules should be more concise, without the "why".

Looking back at the examples:

Example 1: Operator fusion between multiple operations.

Example 2: Uses shared memory tiling.

Example 3: Thread block sizes multiples of warp size.

So the rules are concise statements of the technique used, not explanations.

Therefore, the rules extracted should be the techniques applied, not the reasons why they help. So adjusting:

- The kernel uses loop unrolling.

But the reasoning specifies unrolling by a factor of 4. However, the rule should be general. So perhaps:

- The kernel employs loop unrolling to reduce control overhead.

But the example given in the user's examples includes the purpose, like "to reduce global memory access". So maybe including the purpose is okay.

Wait, example 2 says "uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access". So the structure is "technique + purpose".

Therefore, the rules should be in the form of "technique + purpose".

So applying that:

1. The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
2. The kernel enables compiler optimizations (-O2 and --use_fast_math) to generate more efficient machine code.
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., 1024 threads per block) to better utilize GPU resources.
4. The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing.

But the user's examples don't mention specific compiler flags. The rules should be general. However, the flags are specific, but maybe the general rule is about enabling compiler optimizations. But the example given in the reasoning is specific to -O2 and --use_fast_math. However, the rule should be general. So perhaps:

- The kernel enables aggressive compiler optimizations (e.g., -O2, --use_fast_math).

But the user's examples don't have such specifics. Alternatively, the rule could be:

- The kernel is compiled with optimization flags that enable fused multiply-add and reduced precision checks.

But that's getting into specifics. Alternatively, the general idea is using compiler optimizations for performance, so:

- The kernel uses compiler optimizations such as -O2 and --use_fast_math to enable aggressive code optimization.

But the user's examples don't include compiler flags. Hmm. The example rules are about code structure, not build flags. So maybe the compiler flags are not considered a kernel code rule, but a build configuration. The question is about the kernel's code, but the reasoning mentions compiler flags as part of the kernel setup. The user's examples include operator fusion and shared memory tiling, which are code changes. The compiler flags are part of the build process, not the kernel code. So perhaps the rules should exclude the compiler flags, as they are not part of the kernel code itself. The user's task is to extract rule-like statements implied by the reasoning. The reasoning does mention the compiler flags as a factor, but the examples given by the user are about code structure. So maybe the answer should include the compiler flags as a rule, but the user's examples don't have such. However, the user's instruction says "rule-like statements implied by the reasoning", so if the reasoning includes compiler flags as a reason, then it should be included.

But the user's examples are all about code structure. For example, operator fusion is a code change. Shared memory tiling is a code technique. Thread block size is a code parameter. Compiler flags are part of the build process. So perhaps the answer should not include the compiler flags as a kernel code rule. But the reasoning explicitly mentions them as a key factor. The user's question says "extract any rule-like statements implied by the reasoning to indicate the difference". So if the reasoning says that using -O2 and --use_fast_math is a reason, then it should be included as a rule. However, the examples provided by the user don't include build flags. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the answer should focus on code-related rules and exclude build flags. But the user's instruction doesn't specify that. The examples are code-related, but the reasoning includes build flags. So perhaps the answer should include them. Let me check the reasoning again.

The reasoning says: "Kernel 2 uses '-O2' and '--use_fast_math'. Those flags can enable more aggressive optimizations. The first kernel might not have those flags, leading to less optimized code." So the difference is in the compiler flags used. Therefore, a rule-like statement would be that the kernel is compiled with specific optimization flags. But is that a rule about the kernel code? Or is it a build setting? The user's examples don't include such, but the question says to extract any rule-like statements from the reasoning, regardless of whether they are code or build related. So perhaps it should be included.

So the rules would be:

1. The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
2. The kernel is compiled with optimization flags (-O2, --use_fast_math) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., 1024 threads per block).
4. The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing.

Additionally, the block size being a multiple of warp size (32) is another possible rule. The example 3 given by the user is "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32)." In the reasoning, Kernel 2 uses 32x32 blocks, which are multiples of 32. So that's another rule. However, the reasoning mentions that 32x32 is the maximum block size (1024 threads), which is about occupancy, but also the tile size is 32, aligning with warp size. So two separate rules: one about block size being multiples of warp size, and another about tile size alignment.

Wait, the reasoning says: "The TILE_SIZE=32 in Kernel 2 aligns with GPU warp size (32 threads), improving memory coalescing for global memory accesses." So that's a separate rule about tile size alignment. The block size being 32x32 (1024 threads) is about maximizing occupancy, but also each dimension is a multiple of 32. However, the example rule is about block sizes being multiples of warp size. So perhaps the block size being 32x32 (each dimension a multiple of 32) is another rule. But the reasoning doesn't explicitly mention that the block dimensions are multiples of 32, just that the tile size is 32. Wait, the block size is 32x32, which is 1024 threads. The tile size is 32, which is the same as the warp size. So the tile size alignment is a separate rule. The block size being 32x32 is about occupancy, but the dimensions (32x32) are multiples of the warp size (32). So each block dimension is a multiple of 32. So that's another possible rule: using thread block dimensions that are multiples of the warp size (32). But the reasoning doesn't explicitly state that, but the example 3 is such a rule. The reasoning mentions that the tile size aligns with warp size, but the block size is 32x32. So perhaps the block dimensions being multiples of 32 is another rule. However, the reasoning emphasizes the block size (1024 threads) for occupancy, not the dimensions. So maybe the main rule is about block size maximizing occupancy, and tile size aligning with warp size.

Putting it all together, the rules extracted are:

1. The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
2. The kernel is compiled with optimization flags (-O2 and --use_fast_math) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., 1024 threads per block).
4. The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing.
5. The kernel uses thread block dimensions that are multiples of the warp size (32).

But need to check if all these are supported by the reasoning.

The reasoning mentions loop unrolling, compiler flags, block size (32x32 for occupancy), tile size alignment with warp size. The block dimensions being 32x32 (each dimension a multiple of 32) is not explicitly mentioned as a reason, but the example 3 given by the user is a similar rule. However, in the reasoning, the block size is 32x32, which is 1024 threads, the maximum. The reasoning says that this improves occupancy. The tile size is 32, aligning with warp size. So the rules would be:

- Loop unrolling
- Compiler flags
- Block size maximizing occupancy
- Tile size aligned with warp size

Additionally, if the block dimensions (32x32) are multiples of warp size (32), that's another rule. But the reasoning doesn't explicitly state that as a reason, but the example 3 is such a rule. However, in the given reasoning, the user's analysis mentions that the tile size of 32 aligns with warp size, leading to better coalescing. The block size being 32x32 is more about occupancy. So perhaps the rules are:

[
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel is compiled with optimization flags (-O2, --use_fast_math) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., 1024 threads per block).",
  "The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing."
]

But the user's example 3 is about thread block sizes being multiples of 32. The reasoning's block size is 32x32, which is a multiple of 32 in each dimension. So perhaps that's another rule: "The kernel uses thread block dimensions that are multiples of the warp size (32)." But the reasoning doesn't explicitly mention that as a reason for performance. The reasoning mentions that the larger block size (1024 threads) improves occupancy, not the dimensions. So maybe that's not a rule here. The tile size alignment is separate.

Another point from the reasoning: "The TILE_SIZE=32 in Kernel 2 aligns with GPU warp size (32 threads), improving memory coalescing for global memory accesses." So the rule is about tile size alignment with warp size.

So the final list would include the four rules above. However, the user's examples show that the rules are concise, like "uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access". So perhaps the compiler flags should be excluded because they are build options, not kernel code structure. But the reasoning includes them as a key factor. The user's instruction says to extract any rule-like statements implied by the reasoning, regardless of whether they are code or build related. So including them is acceptable.

But the user's examples are all code-related. However, the question doesn't restrict to code; it says "various CUDA kernels", which could include build flags. So the answer should include all factors mentioned in the reasoning that are rule-like.

Therefore, the JSON array would be:

[
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel enables compiler optimizations such as -O2 and --use_fast_math for aggressive code optimization.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that maximize occupancy (e.g., 1024 threads per block).",
  "The kernel aligns tile sizes with the GPU warp size (32 threads) to improve memory coalescing."
]

But the second point about compiler flags might be considered a build setting rather than a kernel code rule. However, since the reasoning explicitly mentions it as a factor, it should be included.
