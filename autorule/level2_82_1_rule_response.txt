ANSWER:


Here is the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

    "The kernel preloads frequently accessed parameters (e.g., bias) into registers to reduce global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel organizes thread blocks to process contiguous memory regions, improving memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel uses loop unrolling pragmas to enable compiler optimizations for loops with known iteration counts.",
    "The kernel precomputes and reuses index values within loops to reduce redundant calculations."

### Explanation of Rules:
1. **Preloading Parameters**: Kernel 1 loads the bias value once per thread into a register, avoiding repeated global memory fetches. This reduces global memory traffic, a critical optimization.
2. **Memory Coalescing**: Kernel 1â€™s 3D grid ensures threads in a block access spatially contiguous input data, enabling efficient coalesced memory access patterns.
3. **Loop Unrolling**: Explicit unrolling hints (`#pragma unroll`) allow the compiler to optimize pooling loops, reducing loop overhead and improving parallelism.
4. **Index Reuse**: Precomputing `base_input_idx` outside loops minimizes redundant index calculations, lowering arithmetic overhead.
