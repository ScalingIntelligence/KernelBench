  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let me try to figure out the rule-like statements from the given reasoning. The user wants a list of general CUDA optimization rules that can be applied to various kernels. The examples given are things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, and thread block sizes as multiples of warp size.\n\nLooking at the reasoning, the first point is kernel fusion. The text mentions combining multiple operations into a single kernel to avoid intermediate memory writes. So that's a rule: \"The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations.\"\n\nNext, memory access optimization. The reasoning talks about using 2D block layout and vectorized loads (float2). So vectorized loads for coalesced access would be a rule. Also, using a block layout that matches data dimensions for better locality.\n\nBlock configuration: The kernel uses 2D thread blocks (32x8) which are multiples of warp size (32). Wait, 32x8 is 256, which is a multiple of 32. So that's a rule like using thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size. But the reasoning also mentions 3D grid organization for data locality. Maybe a rule about grid dimensions matching tensor dimensions.\n\nPooling optimization: Loop unrolling with #pragma unroll. So using loop unrolling to reduce overhead.\n\nCompiler optimizations: Using --use_fast_math and -O3. But these are more compile-time flags rather than kernel code rules. The user wants rules about the kernel code itself, not how it's compiled. So maybe exclude those.\n\nRestrict qualifiers: Using __restrict__ to indicate no pointer aliasing, allowing compiler optimizations. That's a code-level rule.\n\nAvoiding intermediate global memory writes by fusing operations. That's covered under operator fusion.\n\nVectorized loads: Using float2 to load two elements at once. So a rule about using vectorized memory accesses.\n\nMemory coalescing through 2D block structure. So organizing threads in 2D to match data layout for coalescing.\n\nCombining batch and channels into grid's z-dimension for better occupancy. That's a grid configuration rule.\n\nProcessing multiple elements per thread with loop unrolling. So using loop unrolling in the kernel code.\n\nSo compiling all these, the rules would be:\n\n1. Operator fusion between multiple operations.\n2. Using vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float2) for coalesced memory access.\n3. Organizing thread blocks in dimensions that match the data structure (e.g., 2D for spatial data).\n4. Using __restrict__ qualifiers to enable compiler optimizations.\n5. Utilizing loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.\n6. Configuring grid dimensions to combine batch and channel dimensions for improved data locality.\n7. Avoiding intermediate global memory writes by processing data in registers across fused operations.\n8. Employing grid-stride loops that match tensor dimensions for better memory access patterns.\n\nI need to check if these are objective and deterministic. For example, \"using vectorized memory accesses\" is a specific technique. \"Organizing thread blocks in dimensions that match data structure\" is a bit vague, but maybe phrased as \"using thread block dimensions that align with the data's spatial dimensions\". The answer should list each as a separate string in a JSON array.\n",
