REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel orders thread indices to prioritize output width, height, then channel and batch dimensions, enabling coalesced writes to the output tensor in NCHW layout.",
    "The kernel groups threads processing the same output channel across spatial positions, allowing broadcasted and coalesced reads from the weight matrix in pointwise convolution.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses to the weight matrix in pointwise convolution by ensuring consecutive threads access contiguous weight elements.",
    "The kernel terminates outer loops early when input indices are out of bounds, reducing redundant inner loop iterations.",
    "The kernel structures thread indexing to maximize spatial locality of input accesses in depthwise convolution, improving cache utilization."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about the performance differences between the two CUDA kernels. These rules focus on thread indexing strategies, memory access patterns (coalescing, strided vs. contiguous), loop optimization, and cache utilization, which are generalizable to other CUDA kernels.
