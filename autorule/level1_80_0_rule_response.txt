REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses compile-time constants for parameters such as kernel size, dilation, and padding to enable loop unrolling.",
    "The kernel avoids runtime variables for loop bounds, allowing the compiler to statically unroll loops and reduce control overhead.",
    "The kernel leverages compile-time known values to precompute constant expressions and optimize index calculations.",
    "The kernel eliminates redundant arithmetic operations by specializing for fixed parameters such as stride=1.",
    "The kernel uses fixed loop bounds to enable compiler optimizations like eliminating redundant bounds checks.",
    "The kernel reduces control flow overhead by statically determining loop iteration counts and memory access patterns."
