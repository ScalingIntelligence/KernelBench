  "The kernel preloads frequently accessed parameters (e.g., bias) into registers to reduce global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel organizes thread blocks to process contiguous memory regions, improving memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling pragmas to enable compiler optimizations for loops with known iteration counts.",
  "The kernel precomputes and reuses index values within loops to reduce redundant calculations."
