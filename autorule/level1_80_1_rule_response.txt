REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids storing intermediate values in registers when recomputing them does not increase computational overhead significantly.",
    "The kernel minimizes register usage by avoiding explicit storage of loop-invariant values outside of inner loops.",
    "The kernel prioritizes lower register pressure over redundant computation to achieve higher GPU occupancy."

ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 1 avoids storing intermediate values (`ih_base`, `iw_base`) explicitly, reducing register pressure and improving occupancy. This leads to three rule-like statements:  
1. Avoiding intermediate register storage when recomputing is feasible.  
2. Minimizing register usage by not hoisting loop-invariant values.  
3. Prioritizing lower register pressure for higher occupancy over redundant computation.  

These rules generalize to CUDA kernels where register usage and occupancy are critical factors.
