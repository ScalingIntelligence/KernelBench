REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses thread block and grid dimensions that result in coalesced writes to the output matrix by mapping consecutive threads to contiguous memory addresses.",
    "The kernel avoids strided global memory writes by ensuring that consecutive threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations for the output matrix.",
    "The kernel prioritizes coalesced write operations over read operations when trade-offs exist between read and write memory access patterns."

ANSWER:


The analysis of the two kernels reveals that the primary performance difference arises from how memory accesses are structured, particularly for writes to the output matrix. Kernel 2's design ensures that consecutive threads write to contiguous memory locations in the output matrix, enabling coalesced memory writes. This optimization significantly reduces global memory access latency, which is critical for performance in CUDA kernels. While Kernel 1 benefits from coalesced reads via a pre-transposed input matrix and read-only caching, its scattered writes to the output matrix negate these advantages. The rules extracted emphasize the importance of coalesced writes, thread mapping strategies, and trade-off prioritization between read and write patterns in CUDA kernel optimization.
