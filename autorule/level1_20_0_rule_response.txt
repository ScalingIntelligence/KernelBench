REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking for rule-like statements based on the reasoning provided. The reasoning compared two CUDA kernels and concluded that one was faster because it reduced global memory accesses by using a local variable.

First, I need to identify the key points in the reasoning. The main difference between the kernels is that Kernel 1 reads the input value once into a local variable (val) and reuses it, while Kernel 2 reads from global memory twice. This leads to fewer global memory accesses in Kernel 1.

The example rules given are things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, and thread block sizes. The rules should be general and applicable to various CUDA kernels, not specific to this exact scenario.

So, the main point here is about reducing global memory accesses by using local variables (registers) to cache values. The rule should capture that practice. The reasoning mentions that accessing global memory is expensive, so minimizing the number of reads improves performance.

Another possible point is efficient use of registers, but the example rules don't mention registers directly. However, the key action here is reusing a value from a register instead of accessing global memory multiple times. So the rule should focus on reducing global memory accesses through local caching.

Looking at the examples, they are concise and describe a specific optimization technique. So the rule here would be something like "The kernel uses local variables to cache global memory values, reducing the number of global memory accesses."

I need to make sure the rule is general. Instead of mentioning "val" or specific variable names, it should state the general practice. The rule should be something that can be applied to other kernels where similar caching is done.

So the implied rule here is that the kernel reduces global memory accesses by caching values in local variables (registers), thus minimizing the number of times global memory is accessed. This is a general optimization technique applicable to many CUDA kernels.

Therefore, the JSON array should include a statement about using local variables to reduce global memory accesses.
