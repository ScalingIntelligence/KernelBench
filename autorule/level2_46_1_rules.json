  "The kernel is specialized for a fixed window size and stride, allowing loop unrolling and eliminating branching for variable parameters.",
  "The kernel writes outputs in a coalesced manner with contiguous threads writing contiguous output elements.",
  "The kernel avoids overhead from handling dynamic parameters or edge cases required in a general-purpose implementation."
