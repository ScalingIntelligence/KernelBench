  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer arguments to enable compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel ensures input and weight tensors are contiguous in memory before access to enable coalesced memory reads/writes.",
  "The kernel precomputes values such as output dimensions on the host side to reduce register pressure and computational overhead in the kernel.",
  "The kernel organizes memory access patterns to align with GPU coalescing requirements, typically by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations."
