REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to enable coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (e.g., 512) to improve GPU occupancy and latency hiding.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses by enforcing contiguous memory layout for input tensors."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. These statements are objective and can be applied to evaluate other CUDA kernels:

1. **Contiguous Memory Enforcement**  
   The first rule highlights the importance of ensuring contiguous memory layouts for input tensors to enable coalesced memory access, a critical optimization for memory-bound operations.

2. **Thread Block Size Optimization**  
   The second rule emphasizes using larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads/block) to improve GPU occupancy and latency hiding, which is particularly relevant for memory-bound kernels.

3. **Strided Access Avoidance**  
   The third rule explicitly calls out avoiding strided memory accesses through contiguity enforcement, a key determinant of memory throughput efficiency.

These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and can be objectively verified by inspecting memory management practices (e.g., `contiguous()` calls) and kernel launch configurations (block size choices).
