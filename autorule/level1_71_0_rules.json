  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
  "The kernel uses logical OR (||) instead of bitwise OR (|) for boundary condition checks to enable short-circuit evaluation.",
  "The kernel allows the compiler to automatically determine loop unrolling factors using #pragma unroll without a specified factor.",
  "The kernel avoids unnecessary parameters and conditional checks for bias handling to reduce overhead.",
  "The kernel uses smaller thread block sizes (e.g., 256) to optimize register pressure and occupancy rather than larger sizes (e.g., 512)."
