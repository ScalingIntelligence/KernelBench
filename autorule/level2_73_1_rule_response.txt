REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids using __ldg() for read-only parameters, relying on L1 cache coherence for warp-uniform accesses.",
    "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to guarantee memory access coalescing.",
    "The kernel uses integer division and modulo operations optimized for powers-of-two dimensions in channel index calculation.",
    "The kernel applies scaling factors during computation instead of during parameter loading to reduce intermediate variable storage and improve register usage."

ANSWER:


The analysis identifies several key optimizations in Kernel 2 that contribute to its slightly better performance. These optimizations are distilled into generalizable rules applicable to CUDA kernel design. The rules focus on memory access patterns, index calculation efficiency, and arithmetic structure, which are critical for optimizing GPU performance. By ensuring tensor contiguity, leveraging cache coherence, and optimizing arithmetic operations, Kernel 2 achieves better hardware utilization. These rules can guide the development of efficient CUDA kernels across various applications.
