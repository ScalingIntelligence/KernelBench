  "The kernel adds numerical stability constants (e.g., epsilon) during reduction phases instead of per-thread during subsequent computations to avoid redundant arithmetic operations.",
  "The kernel minimizes redundant arithmetic operations by performing scalar adjustments (e.g., adding epsilon) once during shared memory updates rather than in per-thread calculations."
