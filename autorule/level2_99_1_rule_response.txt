REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (1024) which is a multiple of the warp size (32) and improves GPU utilization.",
    "The kernel avoids the max reduction step required for numerical stability in softmax, reducing the number of reduction operations.",
    "The kernel uses shared memory proportional to the thread block size rather than the input row size, reducing shared memory consumption and improving occupancy.",
    "The kernel performs fewer reduction steps overall (only sum reduction) compared to kernels performing both max and sum reductions.",
    "The kernel's thread block size choice reduces the number of steps in the reduction phase (log2(block size) steps)."
