  "The kernel uses a multidimensional thread grid structure to align with data layout for efficient memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel implicitly handles memory strides through linear index calculation to avoid explicit stride checks and branching.",
  "The kernel configures grid and block dimensions to match the data's multidimensional structure for improved parallelism.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns to exhibit spatial locality for better cache utilization."
