  "The kernel writes the final result to global memory once after accumulating all intermediate values, reducing global memory writes.",
  "The kernel avoids redundant global memory writes by not updating the output buffer multiple times during intermediate computation steps.",
  "The kernel minimizes global memory traffic by writing results only once per thread after completing all necessary computations."
