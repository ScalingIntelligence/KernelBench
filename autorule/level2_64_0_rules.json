  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) with contiguous memory transactions.",
  "The kernel employs block-level reductions in shared memory for efficient memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel assigns contiguous memory elements per thread to enhance spatial locality.",
  "The kernel minimizes conditional checks in memory access to reduce warp divergence.",
  "The kernel utilizes mathematical functions optimized by CUDA's fast math compiler flags.",
  "The kernel structures shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during reduction phases."
