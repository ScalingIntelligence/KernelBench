REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel orders loops such that input channel iterations are outermost, followed by spatial kernel dimensions, to improve memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel accesses input tensor elements with spatial dimensions (depth, height, width) in inner loops to leverage contiguous memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel accesses weight tensor elements sequentially by iterating over kernel spatial dimensions (depth, height, width) after input channels to match memory layout.",
    "The kernel minimizes strided global memory accesses by avoiding inner loops over input channels for spatial operations.",
    "The kernel uses a data type-specific implementation (e.g., float) instead of templated types to enable compiler optimizations."

ANSWER:


The provided JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These rules focus on loop ordering, memory access patterns, and data type handling, which are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization. Each rule emphasizes deterministic, observable properties (e.g., loop order, memory layout alignment) that can be objectively verified in code.
