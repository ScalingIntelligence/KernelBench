  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the analysis of the two CUDA kernels. These rules highlight critical optimizations such as avoiding branch divergence through loop separation, strategic use of memory qualifiers (`__restrict__`, `__ldg`), and minimizing warp divergence via remainder handling. The rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to general CUDA optimization strategies.",
