    "The kernel minimizes synchronization overhead by avoiding unnecessary __syncthreads() calls after reduction operations.",
    "The kernel computes post-reduction values (e.g., mean, variance) redundantly across threads to eliminate synchronization points.",
    "The kernel reduces shared memory pressure by avoiding storage of intermediate results that can be recomputed locally.",
    "The kernel prioritizes arithmetic operation redundancy over synchronization costs for improved overall performance."
