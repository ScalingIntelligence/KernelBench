  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions and improve coalescing.",
  "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage to allow higher occupancy by reducing per-block shared memory consumption.",
  "The kernel employs contiguous memory access patterns instead of strided access to improve spatial locality and cache utilization.",
  "The kernel uses mathematical approximations (e.g., tanhf-based GELU) instead of exact functions (e.g., erff) for faster computation.",
  "The kernel reuses shared memory buffers across multiple reduction phases to reduce total shared memory allocation.",
  "The kernel fuses activation functions into fewer conditional operations to reduce branch instructions."
