REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel precomputes constants outside of the kernel to avoid runtime calculations in each thread.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to indicate no aliasing, enabling more aggressive compiler optimizations for memory accesses.",
    "The kernel forces inline expansion of device functions to reduce function call overhead."

ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies several optimizations in Kernel 1 that contribute to its slightly faster performance compared to Kernel 2. The key differences are distilled into three rule-like statements:

1. **Precomputed Constants**: Kernel 1 avoids runtime calculations (e.g., `sqrtf(2.0f / M_PI)`) by using precomputed constants, reducing per-thread computational overhead. This is generalized to a rule about precomputing constants outside the kernel.

2. **`__restrict__` Usage**: Kernel 1 uses `__restrict__` to signal no pointer aliasing, allowing the compiler to optimize memory operations. This becomes a rule about leveraging `__restrict__` for memory access optimizations.

3. **Forced Inlining**: Kernel 1 explicitly inlines `tanhf` via `__forceinline__`, minimizing function call overhead. This is generalized to a rule about inlining device functions.

These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels broadly.
