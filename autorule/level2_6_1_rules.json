  "The kernel uses sequential loops for reductions within a thread instead of parallel reductions across threads.",
  "The kernel configures thread block sizes as multiples of the warp size (32) to optimize occupancy.",
  "The kernel avoids shared memory for intermediate reductions by using register storage.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.",
  "The kernel minimizes synchronization steps by avoiding inter-thread communication during reductions."
