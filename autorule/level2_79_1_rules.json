  "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration to maximize occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks per streaming multiprocessor (SM).",
  "The kernel avoids shared memory usage to prevent shared memory pressure and loading overhead, especially when the data size is large.",
  "The kernel uses a thread block size of 256 threads, which is a common choice for balancing occupancy and resource utilization.",
  "The kernel prioritizes higher occupancy over complex memory access optimizations, compensating for non-coalesced global memory accesses with simpler execution patterns.",
  "The kernel minimizes register pressure by using straightforward per-thread loops, enabling more concurrent threads on the SM."
