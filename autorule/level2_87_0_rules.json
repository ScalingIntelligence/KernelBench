  "The kernel uses numerically stable functions (e.g., log1pf) for improved precision in sensitive operations.",
  "The kernel avoids redundant intermediate variable assignments, allowing for potential compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel ensures mathematical equivalence through alternative expressions that may leverage compiler intrinsics or optimized library functions."
