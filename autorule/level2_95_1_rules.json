  "The kernel avoids vectorized operations (e.g., float4) to reduce register pressure and increase thread occupancy.",
  "The kernel uses the exact GELU implementation with erff instead of a tanh-based approximation to reduce computational complexity.",
  "The kernel processes one element per thread to minimize register usage and enable higher occupancy.",
  "The kernel employs a grid configuration with more smaller thread blocks for better workload distribution across GPU SMs.",
  "The kernel uses scalar operations instead of per-component vector operations to reduce instruction count and branching overhead."
