REASONING TRACE:
["The kernel avoids redundant modulus operations by not computing unused intermediate variables.", "The kernel passes tensor dimensions as separate parameters (e.g., H, W) rather than precomputed products (e.g., H*W) to enable compiler optimizations.", "The kernel orders frequently accessed parameters (e.g., bias pointer) earlier in the argument list to improve register allocation efficiency."]
