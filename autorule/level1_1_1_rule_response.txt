### Explanation of Key Rules:
1. **Larger Tile Size**: Increases data reuse in shared memory, reducing global memory access frequency.
2. **Sub-Tiling/Register Blocking**: Boosts arithmetic intensity by having each thread compute multiple elements.
3. **Shared Memory Padding**: Avoids bank conflicts by adjusting memory layout (e.g., `[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE + 1]`).
4. **Coalesced Memory Access**: Ensures contiguous global memory access patterns for efficient data transfers.
5. **Loop Unrolling**: Minimizes loop control overhead and enhances compiler optimization opportunities.
6. **Register Tiling**: Stores partial results in registers instead of shared memory, reducing latency.
7. **Block Configuration**: Balances thread count and resource usage to improve occupancy and parallelism.
