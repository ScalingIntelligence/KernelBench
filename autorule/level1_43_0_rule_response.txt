ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. Each statement captures a specific optimization technique or practice that can be objectively assessed in CUDA kernels. These include precomputing loop ranges to reduce iterations, using fused dimensions for efficient indexing, employing grid-stride loops, optimizing thread block sizes for occupancy, leveraging read-only cache via intrinsics, minimizing conditional branches, and reducing arithmetic operations. These rules are generalizable and applicable to various CUDA kernel implementations.
