  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array captures the key rule-like differences between the kernels. The first rule highlights the use of `rsqrtf` for faster inverse standard deviation calculation. The second and third rules contrast the reduction strategies: Kernel 1 trades redundant computation for broadcast efficiency and avoids synchronization, while Kernel 2 uses a theoretically better tree reduction at the cost of sync overhead. The fourth rule addresses shared memory footprint differences. These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel design beyond this specific case.",
