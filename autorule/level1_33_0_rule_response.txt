REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to load/store multiple elements per transaction.",
    "The kernel organizes the grid into 2D dimensions (e.g., batch and channel) to improve memory locality and parameter reuse.",
    "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread to reduce instruction overhead and improve arithmetic intensity.",
    "The kernel aligns memory access patterns to maximize coalescing and cache utilization.",
    "The kernel reduces redundant global memory accesses by reusing parameters (e.g., scale, shift) across threads in the same block."
