  "The kernel uses a multi-dimensional grid configuration that aligns with the output tensor's dimensions to enable coalesced memory writes.",
  "The kernel organizes thread blocks to group threads accessing contiguous memory locations for efficient memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel avoids flattening grid dimensions, preserving spatial locality in memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32)."
