  "The kernel flattens multiple dimensions into a single contiguous dimension to enable coalesced memory access.",
  "The kernel simplifies index calculations by precomputing aggregated dimensions to reduce arithmetic operations.",
  "The kernel enforces tensor contiguity and data type constraints to ensure optimal memory layout.",
  "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses by restructuring multidimensional indices into contiguous flattened indices."
