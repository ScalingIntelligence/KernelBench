REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel is specialized for a fixed window size and stride, allowing loop unrolling and eliminating branching for variable parameters.",
    "The kernel writes outputs in a coalesced manner with contiguous threads writing contiguous output elements.",
    "The kernel avoids overhead from handling dynamic parameters or edge cases required in a general-purpose implementation."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. These statements capture the key differences between the custom kernel and the general-purpose PyTorch implementation, focusing on specialization, memory access patterns, and reduced overhead. Each statement is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
