REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses contiguous memory access patterns to enable memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel uses a block-wide parallel tree reduction in shared memory for efficient reductions.",
    "The kernel configures thread blocks to handle consecutive elements in the channel dimension for optimal memory access.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses that lead to scattered memory operations.",
    "The kernel minimizes synchronization points by using a single block-wide reduction instead of multiple warp-level reductions.",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that align with power-of-two channel counts for efficient tree reduction steps."
