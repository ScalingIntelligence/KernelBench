  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided a list of CUDA kernel rules that might have duplicates or similar entries. My job is to merge them into a JSON array without duplicates. Let me start by reading through each rule carefully.\n\nFirst, I notice there are two entries about using a larger tile size (32x32) to reduce the number of tiles and loop iterations. These seem similar, so I can combine them into one rule mentioning both benefits.\n\nNext, there are multiple mentions of coalesced memory access. One says the kernel loads global memory in coalesced patterns, another mentions coalesced access for matrix B, and another ensures input tensors are contiguous for coalesced access. These all relate to coalesced memory access, so I'll merge them into a single rule covering all aspects.\n\nBank conflicts are mentioned in two rules: padding shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts and avoiding them during computation. These can be combined into a single rule about avoiding shared memory bank conflicts through padding and access patterns.\n\nThread block configuration comes up a couple of times. One mentions 8x8 threads per block to match warp sizes, another uses a block size of 512. Wait, 8x8 is 64 threads, which is 2 warps (assuming 32 threads per warp). But 512 threads per block is a different approach. Hmm, maybe these are separate. The 8x8 might be about matching warp size for occupancy, while 512 is a different block size. So perhaps they should stay separate. But maybe the user intended them to be merged. Let me check: 8x8 is 64 threads, which is 2 warps. 512 threads per block would be 16 warps. Both relate to thread block size and occupancy. Maybe the user intended different optimizations here. Alternatively, perhaps the 8x8 is a specific example, and 512 is another. So maybe they should be separate. But the user says to merge duplicates. Let me see: \"configures thread blocks to match GPU warp sizes (8x8 threads per block)\" and \"uses a thread block size of 512\". These are different approaches. So they might need to stay as separate rules. But maybe the 512 is a typo, or perhaps they are different contexts. Since the user says to merge duplicates, perhaps these are separate and should remain. So I'll keep them as separate entries.\n\nParameters reduction: there are three rules about avoiding unused parameters, using fewer parameters, and omitting redundant parameters. These all relate to reducing the number of parameters to improve register usage. So merge them into one rule about reducing parameters to improve register pressure and occupancy.\n\nLoop unrolling is mentioned once, so that stays.\n\nSpecialized for float data type: that's a unique point.\n\nStoring partial sums in registers: unique.\n\nSub-tiling with 4x4 submatrix: unique.\n\nFused division/modulus for channel indices: unique.\n\nSo compiling all these, the merged list would have:\n\n1. Sub-tiling with 4x4 submatrix per thread.\n2. Padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts and ensuring access patterns prevent them.\n3. Coalesced global memory access for inputs (including matrix B) by ensuring contiguous tensors and consecutive thread access.\n4. Loop unrolling via pragmas.\n5. Larger tile size (32x32) to reduce tiles and loop iterations, improving data reuse.\n6. Thread block configurations: 8x8 to match warp size and 512 threads for occupancy. Wait, but these are two different configurations. How to merge? The original rules are two separate points. The user might have intended that these are different optimizations, so perhaps they should be separate. But maybe the 8x8 is a way to match warp size, while 512 is a block size. So they are separate. So two separate rules: one about matching warp sizes (8x8), another about block size 512. But the user says to merge duplicates. Are these similar? Not exactly. So perhaps they stay as separate entries.\n\nWait, the original list has:\n\n- \"configures thread blocks to match GPU warp sizes (8x8 threads per block) for improved occupancy.\"\n\n- \"uses a thread block size of 512 to improve GPU occupancy.\"\n\nThese are two different block sizes. So they can't be merged. So they remain separate.\n\nSo the final merged list would have:\n\n- The kernel uses sub-tiling where each thread computes a 4x4 submatrix of the output.\n\n- The kernel pads shared memory arrays and avoids bank conflicts during access.\n\n- The kernel loads global memory data in coalesced patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive addresses, uses coalesced access for matrix B, and ensures input tensors are contiguous.\n\n- The kernel unrolls inner loops using pragma directives to reduce loop overhead.\n\n- The kernel employs a larger tile size (32x32) to reduce the number of tiles, improve data reuse, and reduce loop iterations.\n\n- The kernel configures thread blocks to match GPU warp sizes (8x8 threads per block) for improved occupancy.\n\n- The kernel uses a thread block size of 512 to improve GPU occupancy.\n\n- The kernel stores intermediate partial sums in registers rather than shared memory to reduce access latency.\n\n- The kernel is specialized for a specific data type (float) allowing compiler optimizations.\n\n- The kernel computes channel indices via fused division/modulus operations (e.g., rem = idx % (C*H*W); c = rem/(H*W)) to reduce instruction count.\n\n- The kernel avoids passing unused parameters, uses fewer parameters, and omits redundant parameters to reduce register pressure and improve occupancy.\n\nWait, but the original three rules about parameters are merged into one. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final JSON array would have these merged rules. Let me count the original rules and merged ones. Original had 17 entries. After merging, how many? Let's see:\n\n1. Sub-tiling 4x4\n\n2. Shared memory padding and avoiding bank conflicts\n\n3. Coalesced memory (merged 3 into 1)\n\n4. Loop unrolling\n\n5. Larger tile size 32x32 (merged 2 into 1)\n\n6. Thread block 8x8\n\n7. Thread block 512\n\n8. Partial sums in registers\n\n9. Specialized for float\n\n10. Fused division/modulus\n\n11. Fewer parameters (merged 3 into 1)\n\nSo 11 merged rules. The original had 17, so merged 6 duplicates. That seems right.\n",
