REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels and trying to figure out why one is faster. The key points mentioned are contiguous memory, block size, index calculations, and avoiding redundant checks.

First, the contiguous memory. The reasoning says that Kernel 2 uses .contiguous() to ensure the tensor is in a contiguous layout. This leads to coalesced memory accesses, which are more efficient. That's a clear rule because using contiguous memory is an objective design choice.

Next, block size. Kernel 2 uses 512 threads per block versus 256 in Kernel 1. The user mentions that larger block sizes can improve GPU occupancy. Since block size is a numerical value that can be checked, this is a rule-like statement.

Then, the index calculation. Kernel 2 computes 'rem' as idx % (C*H*W) and then 'c' as rem/(H*W). The reasoning suggests this allows the compiler to fuse division and modulus operations, reducing instructions. This is a specific implementation detail that can be objectively verified by looking at the code.

Lastly, avoiding redundant checks. The reasoning mentions Kernel 2 leverages the 4D structure (NCHW) directly, while Kernel 1 uses num_elements. However, the example rule-like statements given by the user are more about specific techniques (like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, thread block sizes). The "avoiding redundant checks" part is a bit vague and might not fit as a deterministic rule. So maybe that's not included.

So the valid rule-like statements would be about contiguous memory, block size, and optimized index calculation via fused division/modulus. The fourth point about avoiding redundant checks might be too vague or not a clear rule, so it's excluded.


ANSWER:


[
    "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to enable coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel uses a thread block size of 512 to improve GPU occupancy.",
    "The kernel computes channel indices via fused division/modulus operations (e.g., rem = idx % (C*H*W); c = rem/(H*W)) to reduce instruction count."
