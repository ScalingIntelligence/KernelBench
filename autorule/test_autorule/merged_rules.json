  "The kernel uses sub-tiling where each thread computes a 4x4 submatrix of the output.",
  "The kernel pads shared memory arrays and avoids bank conflicts during access to optimize memory operations.",
  "The kernel loads global memory data in coalesced patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive addresses, including for matrix B, and ensures input tensors are contiguous.",
  "The kernel unrolls inner loops using pragma directives to reduce loop overhead.",
  "The kernel employs a larger tile size (32x32) to reduce the number of tiles, improve data reuse, and minimize loop iterations.",
  "The kernel configures thread blocks to match GPU warp sizes (e.g., 8x8 threads per block) and optimizes block size (e.g., 512 threads) for improved occupancy.",
  "The kernel stores intermediate partial sums in registers rather than shared memory to reduce access latency.",
  "The kernel is specialized for a specific data type (float) to enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel computes channel indices via fused division/modulus operations (e.g., rem = idx % (C*H*W); c = rem/(H*W)) to reduce instruction count.",
  "The kernel avoids passing unused parameters and uses fewer parameters to reduce register pressure and improve occupancy."
