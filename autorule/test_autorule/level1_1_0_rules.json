  "The kernel uses sub-tiling where each thread computes a 4x4 submatrix of the output.",
  "The kernel pads shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts during access.",
  "The kernel loads global memory data in coalesced patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive addresses.",
  "The kernel unrolls inner loops using pragma directives to reduce loop overhead.",
  "The kernel employs a larger tile size (32x32) to reduce the number of tiles and improve data reuse.",
  "The kernel configures thread blocks to match GPU warp sizes (8x8 threads per block) for improved occupancy.",
  "The kernel stores intermediate partial sums in registers rather than shared memory to reduce access latency."
