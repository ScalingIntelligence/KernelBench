    "The kernel precomputes H*W on the host and passes it as a parameter to avoid per-thread multiplication.",
    "The kernel reduces per-thread arithmetic operations by eliminating redundant integer multiplications.",
    "The kernel minimizes computational overhead by offloading redundant calculations to the host."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. These statements highlight objective differences between the kernels, such as precomputing values on the host to reduce per-thread computations and minimizing arithmetic operations.
