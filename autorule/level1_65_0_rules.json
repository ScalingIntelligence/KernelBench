  "The kernel uses thread block dimensions that allow consecutive threads to access consecutive memory addresses in the output tensor for coalesced writes.",
  "The kernel orders loops over input channels before kernel dimensions to leverage contiguous weight tensor access patterns.",
  "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses to the weight tensor by maintaining sequential access along kernel dimensions within inner loops.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that maintain spatial locality in weight tensor accesses for better cache utilization.",
  "The kernel organizes thread blocks to process contiguous regions of output tensor dimensions (height and width) to balance coalescing and cache efficiency."
