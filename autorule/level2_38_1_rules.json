  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per memory transaction",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32)",
  "The kernel uses a grid organization that matches the data layout dimensions for better memory coalescing",
  "The kernel is compiled with fast math optimizations (e.g., --use_fast_math) to approximate transcendental functions",
  "The kernel reduces loop iterations by processing multiple elements per loop iteration through vectorization",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing",
  "The kernel optimizes shared memory layout to minimize bank conflicts during reductions"
