  "response": "\n\nThe analysis identifies that the performance difference stems from the use of 32-bit vs. 64-bit integer operations. Kernel 1 uses 32-bit integers (`int`) for loop counters and indices, which are more efficient on GPUs, while Kernel 2 uses 64-bit integers (`int64_t`), introducing overhead. The rules derived focus on data type optimization, arithmetic efficiency, and register usage, which are generalizable to CUDA kernels. These rules are objective and deterministic, as they can be verified by inspecting variable types and loop structures in kernel code.",
