REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel precomputes batch normalization parameters (scale and shift) during evaluation mode to avoid recomputation in each forward pass.",
    "The kernel separates training and inference paths to optimize for specific operations in each mode.",
    "The kernel uses precomputed buffers for parameters to reduce Python/CUDA context switching and kernel launch overhead.",
    "The kernel avoids recalculating parameters (e.g., inverse standard deviation, scale, shift) on-the-fly during inference."

ANSWER:


The JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules focus on optimizations related to precomputing parameters, separating execution paths for different modes, reducing overhead through precomputed buffers, and avoiding redundant calculations. Each statement is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization strategies.
