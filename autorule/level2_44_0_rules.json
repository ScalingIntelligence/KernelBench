  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce memory transactions and improve coalescing.",
  "The kernel employs warp-level reduction using shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) to minimize shared memory usage.",
  "The kernel precomputes and fuses scaling factors to reduce per-element arithmetic operations.",
  "The kernel utilizes contiguous memory access patterns to align with GPU coalescing requirements.",
  "The kernel implements a hierarchical reduction strategy combining warp-level and shared memory reductions.",
  "The kernel uses a grid configuration that aligns with data organization to reduce indexing overhead."
