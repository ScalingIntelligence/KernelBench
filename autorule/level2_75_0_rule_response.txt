REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses floor division with explicit remainder handling for workload distribution when the input size is a multiple of the block size.",
    "The kernel ensures perfect load balancing across all threads when the input size is divisible by the thread block size.",
    "The kernel assigns residual elements exclusively to the last thread in the block when using floor division for workload distribution.",
    "The kernel uses chunk sizes that align with input dimensions divisible by the thread block size to avoid thread divergence and idle threads.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns by ensuring aligned work chunks when input dimensions are multiples of the block size."
