  "The kernel uses loop unrolling for fixed-size loops to reduce branch overhead and enable better instruction pipelining.",
  "The kernel employs memory coalescing by restructuring index calculations to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to prevent pointer aliasing and enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel precomputes memory strides and reuses base pointers to minimize redundant address calculations.",
  "The kernel specializes for fixed kernel sizes, allowing constant propagation and compile-time optimizations.",
  "The kernel uses fast math compilation flags to enable approximate floating-point optimizations.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns by aligning with spatial dimensions for contiguous access."
