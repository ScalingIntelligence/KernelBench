Each statement captures a distinct optimization technique or practice that contributes to the kernel's performance. The rules are objective and can be applied to other CUDA kernels for analysis or optimization purposes. \n\n1. **`__restrict__` qualifier usage** ensures the compiler can optimize memory accesses by assuming no pointer aliasing.\n2. **Fast math compilation flag** directly impacts the speed of expensive mathematical operations by using approximations.\n3. **Numerically stable log-sum-exp implementation** demonstrates how algorithmic choices interact with hardware optimizations.\n4. **Precomputing constants** reduces redundant calculations, improving efficiency in loops. \n\nThese rules are generalizable and can be objectively verified by examining kernel code or compilation flags.",
