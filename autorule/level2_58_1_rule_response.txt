REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel computes multiple intermediate values (e.g., max and sum) in a single loop over the data instead of multiple separate loops.",
    "The kernel uses memory access patterns that enable coalesced global memory accesses by structuring indices to access contiguous memory locations across related dimensions (e.g., channels).",
    "The kernel employs compiler flags (e.g., -use_fast_math) to enable faster mathematical intrinsics (e.g., __expf, __logf) at the cost of reduced precision.",
    "The kernel replaces division operations with multiplication by precomputed reciprocals to reduce computational overhead.",
    "The kernel uses read-only memory access intrinsics (e.g., __ldg) for uniform or frequently accessed data to leverage caching optimizations.",
    "The kernel declares pointers with __restrict__ to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
    "The kernel optimizes numerical stability in iterative calculations (e.g., adjusting sum_exp when max changes) to avoid recomputation and maintain precision with fewer operations."
