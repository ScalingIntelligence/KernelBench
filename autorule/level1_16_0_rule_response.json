  "response": "\n\nThe two kernels differ in their memory access optimizations, which are critical for CUDA performance. The JSON array below summarizes the rule-like statements derived from the analysis:\n\n[\n    \"The kernel uses coalesced global memory access for loading matrix B into shared memory.\",\n    \"The kernel avoids non-coalesced global memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses during shared memory loading.\",\n    \"The kernel minimizes shared memory bank conflicts during computation by aligning thread access patterns with shared memory bank organization.\"\n]\n\nThese rules explain why Kernel 2 achieves marginally better performance through: 1) Coalesced access for B (stride-1), 2) Avoidance of large-stride access patterns for critical operations, and 3) Shared memory access patterns that reduce bank conflicts during the computation phase.",
