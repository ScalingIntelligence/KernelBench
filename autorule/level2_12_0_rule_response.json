The observed runtime difference (6.98 ms vs. 6.99 ms) is within the margin of measurement noise and does not reflect a meaningful performance difference. No rule-like statements can be extracted from the reasoning because the kernels are structurally and functionally the same.\n\n```json\n[]\n```",
