REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel reduces global memory accesses by reading input data once and reusing it via shared memory for multiple operations.",
    "The kernel computes expensive operations (e.g., expf) once per element and reuses the result across subsequent calculations.",
    "The kernel fuses multiple computation phases (e.g., max reduction, sum reduction, normalization) into a single pass to avoid redundant global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel uses shared memory to store intermediate values for reductions, minimizing global memory traffic.",
    "The kernel employs a block size that matches the data dimension (e.g., num_channels) to enable coalesced memory access patterns for contiguous data.",
    "The kernel avoids multiple passes over input data by consolidating all required computations into a single kernel launch."
