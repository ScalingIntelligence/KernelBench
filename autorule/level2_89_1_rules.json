  "The kernel uses __ldg() intrinsic to leverage the read-only cache for input and parameter accesses.",
  "The kernel replaces conditional branches with fmaxf() for max operations to avoid warp divergence.",
  "The kernel precomputes base indices to reduce redundant index calculations during channel iterations.",
  "The kernel accesses per-channel parameters using read-only cache to enable efficient reuse across threads.",
  "The kernel structures memory accesses to improve coalescing by offsetting base indices with channel strides."
