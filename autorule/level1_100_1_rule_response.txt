REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop to process elements, enabling full GPU occupancy regardless of input dimensions.",
    "The kernel employs coalesced memory accesses to contiguous 1D tensors without explicit vectorization.",
    "The kernel performs a single efficient block reduction in shared memory followed by atomic adds.",
    "The kernel fuses element-wise computation and reduction into a single kernel launch.",
    "The kernel minimizes control flow complexity to avoid warp divergence.",
    "The kernel structures work distribution to ensure all threads participate in useful computation."

ANSWER:


Here's the analysis of the key differences presented as objective, generalizable rules:

1. **Grid-Stride Loop Pattern**  
   Kernel 2's use of grid-stride loops ensures full thread utilization regardless of input size, while Kernel 1's per-block batch processing leads to underutilization.

2. **Coalesced Memory Access**  
   Kernel 2's linear memory access pattern enables efficient coalescing without explicit vectorization requirements seen in Kernel 1.

3. **Unified Reduction Strategy**  
   The single-stage block reduction in Kernel 2 avoids the multi-stage (warp + block) reduction overhead present in Kernel 1.

4. **Operation Fusion**  
   Kernel 2 demonstrates true fusion by combining element-wise operations with reduction in a single kernel, unlike Kernel 1's implicit multi-stage approach.

5. **Control Flow Simplicity**  
   Kernel 2's minimal branching contrasts with Kernel 1's complex control flow for vector remainder handling and warp management.

6. **Work Distribution Strategy**  
   Kernel 2's element-centric work distribution ensures better parallelism compared to Kernel 1's batch-centric approach.

These rules capture fundamental CUDA optimization principles that can be objectively evaluated in any kernel through code inspection and profiling metrics like occupancy and memory transaction patterns.
