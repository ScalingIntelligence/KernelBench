REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a custom approximation of mathematical functions (e.g., tanh) to reduce computation time.",
    "The kernel is compiled with --use_fast_math to enable faster, approximate versions of math functions (e.g., expf).",
    "The kernel avoids redundant index calculations by only computing necessary indices for the operations performed.",
    "The kernel uses __forceinline__ to inline critical functions, reducing function call overhead."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement captures a distinct optimization strategy or code characteristic that contributes to the performance difference between the two kernels. These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels in general.
