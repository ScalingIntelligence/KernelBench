  "The kernel fuses multiple consecutive operations into a single kernel launch.",
  "The kernel retains intermediate results in registers instead of global memory to reduce memory traffic.",
  "The kernel configures grid dimensions based on the output tensor size to optimize thread count.",
  "The kernel computes intermediate values on-the-fly during subsequent operations to avoid redundant computation."
