REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a smaller tile size to reduce shared memory usage per block, allowing more blocks to be active on each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that result in higher occupancy by fitting more blocks within the shared memory and thread count limits of the SM.",
    "The kernel optimizes global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes through appropriate thread indexing and tile dimensions.",
    "The kernel avoids shared memory bank conflicts by aligning memory accesses to different banks within a warp."

ANSWER:


The provided reasoning highlights several factors contributing to the performance difference between the two kernels. The key rule-like statements derived from this analysis are:

1. **Smaller tile size reducing shared memory usage** - This allows more blocks to be active per SM, improving occupancy.
2. **Thread block size optimization for occupancy** - Smaller blocks fit within resource constraints, enabling more concurrent blocks.
3. **Coalesced global memory access patterns** - Both kernels achieve this through proper thread indexing and tile dimensions.
4. **Avoidance of shared memory bank conflicts** - Achieved through proper data layout and access patterns.

These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and can be objectively verified through shared memory usage calculations, occupancy calculators, and memory access pattern analysis.
