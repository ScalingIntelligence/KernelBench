REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses spatial-level parallelism by assigning one thread per spatial element and serially processing all channels.",
    "The kernel uses channel-level parallelism by assigning one thread per channel and processing all spatial elements in parallel.",
    "The kernel employs parallel warp-shuffle and shared memory reductions for channel-level operations.",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes aligned to warp boundaries (multiples of 32).",
    "The kernel utilizes sequential memory access patterns that better utilize register/L1 cache for small working sets.",
    "The kernel maintains high occupancy by using large thread blocks (e.g., 256 threads) across spatial dimensions.",
    "The kernel performs serial reductions within individual threads for small channel counts."
