REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel precomputes loop-invariant start positions outside of nested loops to reduce redundant calculations.",
    "The kernel uses the linear thread index directly for output tensor indexing instead of recalculating equivalent offsets from higher-dimensional indices.",
    "The kernel unravels linear indices into spatial dimensions using sequential division and modulus operations rather than deeply nested calculations."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules highlight deterministic optimizations in Kernel 2 that objectively differentiate it from Kernel 1, such as precomputing loop invariants, leveraging linear indexing, and using sequential index unraveling. Each rule is generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization scenarios.
