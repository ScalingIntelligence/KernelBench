  "The kernel uses loop unrolling via #pragma unroll to reduce branch instructions and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel handles remaining elements after vectorized processing with a secondary loop, avoiding branching in the main loop.",
  "The kernel reduces control flow overhead by eliminating per-iteration condition checks in unrolled loops.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access scheduling by interleaving load/store operations with arithmetic instructions through loop unrolling."
