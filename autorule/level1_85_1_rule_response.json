  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively verifiable.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses a 3D grid with block dimensions (32,8). This is structured to match the data's spatial dimensions, which can improve memory coalescing. So a rule here could be about using grid dimensions that align with data dimensions for better memory access.\n\nNext, the use of shared memory for weights is highlighted. Kernel 2 loads weights into shared memory once per block, reducing global memory accesses. That's a clear optimization technique, so a rule about using shared memory to store reused data from global memory.\n\nThe __ldg() intrinsic is used for input and bias, which leverages the read-only cache. This is a specific CUDA optimization, so a rule about using read-only cache via intrinsics for read-only data.\n\nLoop unrolling with #pragma unroll is mentioned. This is a common optimization, so a rule about unrolling loops to reduce overhead.\n\nThe 2D thread block (32x8) is noted to have threads in a warp accessing consecutive memory, aiding coalescing. Since 32 is the warp size, a rule about block dimensions being multiples or factors of warp size for coalescing.\n\nKernel 2 compiles with -use_fast_math, which is a compiler flag. So a rule about using fast math compiler flags for faster operations.\n\nThe 3D grid's z-dimension handles batch and channels together, promoting data reuse. This could translate to a rule about organizing grid dimensions to group related computations for data reuse.\n\nChecking each point to ensure they're objective and applicable to other kernels. For example, using shared memory for data reuse is a general rule. Similarly, loop unrolling and grid alignment are standard practices. The use of specific intrinsics and compiler flags are also verifiable.\n\nI need to avoid including reasoning about specific tensors or channels, keeping the rules general. Also, ensure each point is a distinct rule without overlapping. Now, compiling these into a JSON array as strings.\n",
