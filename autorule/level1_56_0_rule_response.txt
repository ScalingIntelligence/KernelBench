REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer arguments to enable compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing.",
    "The kernel ensures input and weight tensors are contiguous in memory before access to enable coalesced memory reads/writes.",
    "The kernel precomputes values such as output dimensions on the host side to reduce register pressure and computational overhead in the kernel.",
    "The kernel organizes memory access patterns to align with GPU coalescing requirements, typically by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations."

ANSWER:


The JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These include using `__restrict__` to avoid aliasing, ensuring tensor contiguity for coalesced access, precomputing values on the host, and organizing memory access for coalescing. Each rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels generally.
