REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements.

First, the precomputation of the scale factor. The reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 precomputes the scale factor during initialization, avoiding a multiplication in each forward pass. This implies a general rule about moving computations out of the critical path, like precomputing values to reduce runtime operations. So a rule could be: "The kernel precomputes values during initialization to avoid redundant calculations during execution."

Second, the logsumexp reduction uses fmaxf instead of a conditional branch. The reasoning states that using fmaxf is branchless and avoids warp divergence, which is a CUDA-specific optimization. This suggests a rule about using intrinsic functions instead of conditionals for reductions. So: "The kernel uses intrinsic functions (e.g., fmaxf) instead of conditional branches for reduction operations to prevent warp divergence."

Looking at the additional considerations, there's a mention of separate kernel compilation possibly allowing better optimizations. However, the reasoning notes that this might not directly affect runtime but could help with compiler optimizations. Since it's speculative and not a direct code-based rule, it might not be included as a deterministic rule.

The other points about code organization and kernel caching are noted as not directly affecting runtime, so they're excluded. The Mish kernel's code is identical, so no rule there.

So the two main rules are about precomputing values and using intrinsic functions to avoid branches. These are objective and can be applied to various CUDA kernels.
