REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a grid configuration that organizes threads to access consecutive elements in memory, enabling coalesced memory accesses.",
    "The kernel avoids shared memory and inter-thread communication by computing full sums per thread, eliminating synchronization overhead.",
    "The kernel employs loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing analysis.",
    "The kernel structures memory accesses to have unit strides, avoiding non-coalesced memory transactions caused by large strides.",
    "The kernel uses a grid layout that matches the data dimensionality, improving spatial locality and GPU occupancy."

ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses a grid configuration that organizes threads to access consecutive elements in memory, enabling coalesced memory accesses.",
    "The kernel avoids shared memory and inter-thread communication by computing full sums per thread, eliminating synchronization overhead.",
    "The kernel employs loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable compiler optimizations by avoiding pointer aliasing analysis.",
    "The kernel structures memory accesses to have unit strides, avoiding non-coalesced memory transactions caused by large strides.",
    "The kernel uses a grid layout that matches the data dimensionality, improving spatial locality and GPU occupancy."
]

These statements capture the key optimization principles observed in the comparison while maintaining generality for application to other CUDA kernels. Each rule can be objectively verified by examining kernel code structure, memory access patterns, and compiler directives.
