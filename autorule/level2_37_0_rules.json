  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per thread, reducing memory transactions.",
  "The kernel employs warp-level reductions using intrinsics like __shfl_down_sync instead of shared memory for intra-warp operations.",
  "The kernel reduces shared memory usage by leveraging warp-level primitives, allowing more concurrent thread blocks on the SM.",
  "The kernel utilizes fast math functions (e.g., rsqrtf) and compiler flags (-use_fast_math) for approximate but faster computations.",
  "The kernel optimizes grid configuration to align with vectorized operations, reducing total thread count while maintaining throughput.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ keywords to enable better compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel ensures memory access patterns are coalesced and aligned to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.",
  "The kernel aligns thread block sizes with warp sizes (e.g., multiples of 32) to improve warp-level parallelism and efficiency."
