  "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) for both input and output tensors.",
  "The kernel reduces the number of memory transactions by processing multiple elements per instruction through vectorization.",
  "The kernel minimizes per-element conditional checks in inner loops to reduce branch divergence.",
  "The kernel fuses operations to keep data in vector registers longer, reducing intermediate memory accesses.",
  "The kernel ensures memory coalescing by using aligned contiguous vector accesses for all tensors.",
  "The kernel avoids scalar memory accesses for parameters (e.g., gamma, beta) by using vectorized loads and stores.",
  "The kernel reduces register pressure by maintaining data in vector format during computations."
