REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let me go through the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively verifiable.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses shared memory to cache weights and bias. That translates to a rule about using shared memory to reduce global memory access. So: "The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access."

Next, the thread block sizes in Kernel 2 are 32x8, which are multiples of the warp size (32). The example given in the problem includes a similar rule. So: "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32)."

Kernel 2 employs loop unrolling with #pragma unroll. That's a specific optimization technique. So: "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism."

The use of __ldg() intrinsic is noted. This relates to leveraging the read-only data cache. So: "The kernel uses the __ldg() intrinsic to leverage the read-only data cache for global memory accesses."

The __restrict__ keyword is mentioned, which helps the compiler optimize. So: "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing."

Cooperative loading into shared memory by threads in a block is highlighted. That's a cooperative data loading strategy. So: "The kernel employs cooperative loading of data into shared memory within a thread block."

The grid configuration in Kernel 2 is 3D, which groups computations by batch and channel. This improves locality. So: "The kernel uses a grid configuration that groups related computations (e.g., batch and channel) to improve data locality."

Kernel 2 checks for bias once per block instead of per thread, reducing branching. So: "The kernel reduces thread divergence by minimizing conditional branching within threads."

The reasoning also mentions that Kernel 2's 2D block structure leads to coalesced memory accesses. This is about memory access patterns. So: "The kernel organizes threads to enable coalesced global memory accesses by aligning with data dimensions."

I need to ensure these rules are general and not specific to the example. Each statement should be a general principle applicable to other CUDA kernels. Let me check each one again:

1. Shared memory tiling: General.
2. Thread block multiples of warp size: General.
3. Loop unrolling: General.
4. __ldg() intrinsic: General.
5. __restrict__ qualifiers: General.
6. Cooperative loading into shared memory: General.
7. Grid configuration for data locality: General.
8. Reducing thread divergence via branching: General.
9. Coalesced memory via thread organization: General.

These all fit as rule-like statements. I don't see any that are too specific to the depthwise convolution example. They should apply to various CUDA kernels.
