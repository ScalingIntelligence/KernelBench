  "The kernel uses a grid configuration that aligns with the data geometry to improve spatial locality.",
  "The kernel organizes threads to access contiguous memory locations within warps, enabling coalesced memory accesses.",
  "The kernel explicitly unrolls loops to process multiple elements per iteration, increasing instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel reduces branch divergence by simplifying comparison logic and avoiding conditional checks for tie-breaking.",
  "The kernel uses a grid layout that allows blocks to process full segments of the input data, improving cache utilization."
