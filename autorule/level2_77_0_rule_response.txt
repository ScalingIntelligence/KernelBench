REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels for 3D global average pooling and trying to figure out why Kernel 2 is faster. The main points discussed are about memory access patterns and coalescing.

First, the analysis of Kernel 1's approach: it splits the workload into contiguous chunks per thread. Each thread processes a block of elements, which might lead to non-coalesced memory access because consecutive threads are accessing elements that are far apart in memory. For example, thread 0 handles elements 0-63, thread 1 handles 64-127, etc. Since the elements are laid out with W as the fastest-changing dimension, these chunks might not be contiguous in a way that allows the GPU to coalesce memory accesses efficiently. This results in more memory transactions and lower bandwidth utilization.

Then, looking at Kernel 2: it uses a strided access pattern where each thread processes elements with a stride equal to the block dimension. This means thread 0 accesses element 0, 256, 512, etc., thread 1 accesses 1, 257, 513, and so on. This pattern allows consecutive threads in a warp to access consecutive memory locations, which the GPU can coalesce into a single transaction. This leads to fewer memory requests and better performance.

The reduction steps in both kernels are similar, so that's not the main factor. The key difference is the memory access during the summation phase. The reasoning concludes that Kernel 2's strided approach enables better coalescing, which is the primary reason for its speed advantage.

Now, translating this into rule-like statements. The main points are about memory access patterns and coalescing. The first rule would address the strided loop for coalesced access. The second might mention avoiding contiguous per-thread chunks that lead to non-coalesced access. However, the examples given in the problem (like using shared memory tiling or thread block sizes) are more about positive practices. The reasoning here highlights a specific practice (strided loop) that improves coalescing. So the rules should reflect the general strategies that can be applied to other kernels.

The first rule would be about using a strided loop with block dimension stride to enable memory coalescing. The second could be about avoiding contiguous per-thread chunks that lead to non-coalesced access. However, the second might be a negative statement, but the examples provided in the problem are positive (do X). So perhaps focusing on the positive aspect of using strided access for coalescing.

Another possible angle is the alignment of memory access patterns with the GPU's coalescing requirements. The key takeaway is that Kernel 2's approach allows consecutive threads to access consecutive memory locations, which is optimal for coalescing. Therefore, the rule would be about structuring memory accesses in a way that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses, which is achieved through strided loops with a stride equal to the block dimension.

So the rule-like statements would be:

1. The kernel uses a strided memory access pattern with a stride equal to the thread block dimension to enable coalesced global memory access.
2. The kernel structures memory accesses such that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations, optimizing for memory coalescing.

But the reasoning specifically mentions the loop structure in Kernel 2: "for(int i = threadIdx.x; i < elements; i += blockDim.x)". This is a strided loop where each thread processes elements separated by the block dimension. This leads to consecutive threads accessing consecutive elements, which is good for coalescing. So the rule would be about using a strided loop with blockDim.x as the stride to enable coalescing.

Another point from the reasoning is that Kernel 1's contiguous per-thread chunks lead to non-coalesced access, but the rule should be a positive statement. So the rule would focus on the strided approach rather than the negative.

Therefore, the main rule here is that the kernel uses a strided loop with blockDim.x stride to enable coalesced memory access. This is a generalizable practice for CUDA kernels to optimize memory access patterns.
