REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel precomputes repeated expressions on the host and passes them as parameters to reduce per-thread arithmetic operations.",
    "The kernel inlines intermediate computations to minimize the use of temporary variables and reduce register pressure.",
    "The kernel minimizes the number of parameters passed to reduce register usage and simplify the kernel interface."

ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that Kernel 2 precomputes `hw_d` on the host, reducing per-thread arithmetic operations by replacing three multiplications with a single division. This is captured in the first rule. The second rule addresses the GELU computation, where inlining reduces temporary variables, potentially lowering register pressure. The third rule highlights passing fewer parameters to the kernel, simplifying the interface and reducing register usage. These rules are objective and applicable to other CUDA kernels.
