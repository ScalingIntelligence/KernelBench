  "The kernel processes multiple elements per loop iteration to increase instruction-level parallelism (ILP).",
  "The kernel unrolls warp reduction steps using template conditions instead of a loop, reducing loop overhead.",
  "The kernel uses compiler flags to limit register usage (e.g., --maxrregcount) to improve occupancy.",
  "The kernel employs loop unrolling to reduce the number of loop iterations and associated control overhead.",
  "The kernel structures memory access patterns to process multiple elements (e.g., via float2) per iteration for better memory bandwidth utilization."
