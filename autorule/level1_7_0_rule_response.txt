REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel writes the final result to global memory once after accumulating all intermediate values, reducing global memory writes.",
    "The kernel avoids redundant global memory writes by not updating the output buffer multiple times during intermediate computation steps.",
    "The kernel minimizes global memory traffic by writing results only once per thread after completing all necessary computations."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. These statements focus on the optimization strategies related to global memory access patterns, specifically highlighting how Kernel 1 reduces redundant global memory writes compared to Kernel 2. The rules are generalizable to CUDA kernels and emphasize minimizing global memory traffic through strategic write operations.
