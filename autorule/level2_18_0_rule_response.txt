REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel passes scalar parameters by value instead of using global memory pointers.",
    "The kernel avoids global memory accesses for frequently used parameters by storing them in registers or constant memory.",
    "The kernel uses explicit dynamic shared memory allocation via kernel launch parameters rather than static shared memory declarations.",
    "The kernel reduces overhead by minimizing the use of vectorized data types that require unpacking operations."
