REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general, objective, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 1 uses contiguous float4 vector loads with boundary checks that allow full 128-bit memory transactions. This suggests a rule about using vectorized memory access with proper boundary handling. So, a rule could be: "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) with contiguous memory transactions."

Next, the reduction strategy in Kernel 1 is described as a classic block reduction in shared memory, which is more efficient. This points to a rule like: "The kernel employs block-level reductions in shared memory for efficient memory coalescing."

The thread work assignment in Kernel 1 assigns contiguous elements to each thread, improving spatial locality. This translates to: "The kernel assigns contiguous memory elements per thread to enhance spatial locality."

Kernel 1's simpler control flow with fewer conditionals reduces warp divergence. So another rule: "The kernel minimizes conditional checks in memory access to reduce warp divergence."

The use of tanhf in GELU with fast math optimizations versus erff in Kernel 2 leads to a rule about leveraging fast math functions: "The kernel utilizes mathematical functions optimized by CUDA's fast math compiler flags."

Lastly, Kernel 1's shared memory layout avoids bank conflicts, leading to: "The kernel structures shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during reduction phases."

Each of these points is a general principle applicable to CUDA optimization, making them valid rule-like statements.
