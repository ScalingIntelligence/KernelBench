These statements focus on generalizable CUDA optimization strategies such as operation fusion, memory access patterns, efficient reductions, thread organization, and specialization. Each rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to various CUDA kernels, aligning with the criteria outlined in the problem statement.",
