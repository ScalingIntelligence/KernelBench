REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses shared memory to store frequently accessed data (e.g., bias values) once per block, reducing redundant global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel organizes memory access patterns to ensure contiguous per-iteration accesses within a warp, enabling full coalescing of global memory transactions.",
    "The kernel minimizes global memory bandwidth pressure by reusing data loaded into shared memory across all threads in a block.",
    "The kernel employs loop unrolling with a stride that aligns with thread block dimensions to optimize memory access coalescing."
]


ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies two main optimizations in the faster kernel: **shared memory usage for redundant data** and **contiguous memory access patterns per iteration**. The extracted rules generalize these optimizations into actionable principles applicable to other CUDA kernels. For example, using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic and organizing memory accesses to ensure coalescing are broadly applicable strategies. The rules avoid kernel-specific details (e.g., bias values, loop unrolling factors) to maintain generality.
