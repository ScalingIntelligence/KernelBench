  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. Each statement captures a specific optimization strategy or implementation choice that contributes to the performance difference between the two kernels. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel design and can be objectively verified by examining kernel parameters, memory access patterns, loop structures, grid/block configurations, and feature support. The rules emphasize specialization, memory access efficiency, reduced control flow, and compiler optimization opportunities as key factors in improving kernel performance.",
