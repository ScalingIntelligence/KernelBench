REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids redundant max operations when intermediate values are already non-negative due to prior operations.",
    "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (e.g., 512 threads per block) to improve GPU occupancy and warp concurrency.",
    "The kernel minimizes instruction count by eliminating unnecessary intermediate operations."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These include avoiding redundant operations, optimizing thread block size for GPU occupancy, and reducing instruction count by eliminating unnecessary steps. Each statement is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
