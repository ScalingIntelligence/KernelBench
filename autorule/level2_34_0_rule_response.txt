    "The kernel uses a block size equal to the minimum of 1024 and the number of channels, ensuring full thread utilization for non-power-of-two channel counts.",
    "The kernel avoids power-of-two block size constraints, reducing idle threads during element processing for non-power-of-two channel dimensions.",
    "The kernel prioritizes thread utilization over power-of-two-aligned reductions, optimizing occupancy for irregular channel sizes."
