REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let me go through the reasoning step by step to extract the rule-like statements.

First, the user mentions that Kernel 1 uses warp-level reductions with __shfl_down_sync. This implies a rule about using warp shuffle instructions for reductions instead of block-level methods. So a rule could be: "The kernel uses warp shuffle instructions for reductions."

Next, they talk about shared memory. Kernel 1 uses less shared memory (2*(blockDim.x /32)) compared to Kernel 2. This leads to higher occupancy. So a rule here is: "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage to improve occupancy."

Then, the use of __ldg intrinsic in Kernel 1 for read-only data. That's a specific CUDA optimization, so the rule would be: "The kernel uses __ldg intrinsic for read-only memory accesses."

Kernel 1 uses rsqrtf instead of 1.0f/sqrt(). That's a math optimization, so the rule: "The kernel uses rsqrtf intrinsic for reciprocal square root calculations."

The reasoning also mentions fusing operations in a single loop. So: "The kernel fuses multiple operations into a single loop to reduce memory passes."

Memory coalescing is better in Kernel 1 due to thread block configuration. The rule here: "The kernel configures thread blocks to maximize memory coalescing."

Handling training/inference by broadcasting mean/var via shared memory instead of recomputing. So: "The kernel broadcasts frequently used values through shared memory to avoid redundant computations."

Larger thread blocks (512 vs 256) are mentioned as better utilizing SM resources. The rule: "The kernel uses larger thread blocks to better utilize available thread block slots per streaming multiprocessor."

Avoiding unnecessary synchronization by using warp-level reductions reduces __syncthreads() calls. So: "The kernel minimizes synchronization points by utilizing warp-level operations."

I need to check if these are all objective and general. Each of these points can be applied to other CUDA kernels. For example, using __ldg is a specific action, and checking if a kernel uses that is objective. Similarly, using warp shuffles or minimizing shared memory are all verifiable. The rules are not too specific to the example but general practices. So these should be valid.
