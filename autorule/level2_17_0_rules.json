  "The kernel uses a 2D grid configuration to avoid integer division and modulus operations for index calculations.",
  "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (1024 threads) to reduce loop iterations in reduction phases.",
  "The kernel uses hardware-optimized math operations (e.g., rsqrtf) instead of separate computation steps.",
  "The kernel configures thread block sizes to maximize occupancy and latency hiding through increased active warps per SM."
