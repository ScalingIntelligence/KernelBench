  "The kernel assigns each thread to compute exactly one output element, maximizing parallelism.",
  "The kernel uses flattened indexing to ensure coalesced global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel parallelizes across batches by including the batch index in the flattened thread ID.",
  "The kernel eliminates nested loops over batches and channels in thread execution.",
  "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration with block sizes optimized for GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel reduces redundant coordinate calculations by directly mapping output elements to threads.",
  "The kernel handles grouped convolutions to reduce the number of channels processed per thread.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns for weights through structured index calculations.",
  "The kernel minimizes per-thread computations by avoiding serialized batch processing."
