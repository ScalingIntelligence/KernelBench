REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses shared memory to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., bias vector) for reuse within a thread block, reducing global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel employs __ldg intrinsic to leverage the read-only cache (texture cache) for global memory accesses, improving spatial locality and cache utilization.",
    "The kernel ensures coalesced global memory accesses when loading data into shared memory by using strided loops with strides equal to the number of threads.",
    "The kernel precomputes loop-invariant values (e.g., elements_per_channel) outside the main computation loop to reduce redundant calculations.",
    "The kernel optimizes integer arithmetic operations (e.g., channel index calculation) to minimize computational overhead during thread execution."
