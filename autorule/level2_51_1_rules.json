  "The kernel processes contiguous elements per thread in vectorized chunks to enable better memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel separates full-vector processing from edge cases in separate loops to minimize branch divergence in the main loop.",
  "The kernel uses a hierarchical block-level reduction strategy (shared memory followed by warp shuffle) to utilize parallelism before narrowing to warp-level operations.",
  "The kernel minimizes bank conflicts in shared memory through stride-based reduction steps.",
  "The kernel isolates scalar operations and edge case handling to single-threaded or warp-uniform sections to reduce thread divergence."
