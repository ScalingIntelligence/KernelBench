REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses rsqrtf for reciprocal square root calculation instead of sqrt followed by division.",
    "The kernel performs redundant sum and sum of squares computations across threads with broadcast-optimized shared memory access.",
    "The kernel avoids synchronization overhead by omitting tree reduction steps in favor of warp-coherent broadcast patterns.",
    "The kernel uses less shared memory by storing only input data rather than both data and their squares."

ANSWER:


The JSON array captures the key rule-like differences between the kernels. The first rule highlights the use of `rsqrtf` for faster inverse standard deviation calculation. The second and third rules contrast the reduction strategies: Kernel 1 trades redundant computation for broadcast efficiency and avoids synchronization, while Kernel 2 uses a theoretically better tree reduction at the cost of sync overhead. The fourth rule addresses shared memory footprint differences. These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel design beyond this specific case.
