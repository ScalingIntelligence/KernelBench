REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to enable coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel uses a thread block size that optimizes occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).",
    "The kernel utilizes CUDA intrinsic functions (e.g., fmaxf, fminf) for optimized float operations instead of generic max/min functions."
