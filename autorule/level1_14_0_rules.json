  "The kernel accesses matrix elements in a coalesced manner by ensuring consecutive threads access contiguous memory locations for critical matrix operands.",
  "The kernel avoids non-coalesced memory access patterns by aligning thread indexing with the memory layout of input matrices.",
  "The kernel maps thread indices to matrix dimensions such that consecutive threads access contiguous elements in frequently accessed matrices.",
  "The kernel minimizes strided memory accesses by ensuring thread-block/grid dimensions align with the dominant access pattern of key operands."
