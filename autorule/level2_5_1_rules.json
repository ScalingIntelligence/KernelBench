  "The kernel uses shared memory to store frequently accessed data (e.g., bias values) once per block, reducing redundant global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel organizes memory access patterns to ensure contiguous per-iteration accesses within a warp, enabling full coalescing of global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel minimizes global memory bandwidth pressure by reusing data loaded into shared memory across all threads in a block.",
  "The kernel employs loop unrolling with a stride that aligns with thread block dimensions to optimize memory access coalescing."
