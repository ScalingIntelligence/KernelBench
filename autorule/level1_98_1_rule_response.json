  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants general CUDA optimization rules that can be applied to various kernels.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses a block size of 1024, which is the maximum, leading to better occupancy. This translates to a rule about using larger block sizes to maximize occupancy.\n\nNext, the grid-stride loop in Kernel 2 is simpler and avoids separate vector/scalar phases. This implies a rule about using grid-stride loops for efficient memory access and simpler code structure.\n\nThe reduction strategy in Kernel 2 uses warp-level reductions first with shuffles before shared memory. This points to a rule about prioritizing warp-level reductions with intrinsics before block-level steps.\n\nKernel 2 caps the grid size, reducing atomic operations. So, a rule about limiting grid size to reduce atomic operations.\n\nThe use of `--use_fast_math` in compiler flags is another point, leading to a rule about enabling compiler optimizations for faster math operations.\n\nAlso, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2's approach minimizes shared memory usage and bank conflicts, which suggests a rule about reducing shared memory usage to avoid conflicts.\n\nPutting these together, the rules should be concise and general. Let me check the examples given. The examples include things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, and thread block sizes. The extracted rules here should follow that style.\n\nSo the final list would include points about block size, grid-stride loops, warp-centric reductions, grid size capping, compiler flags, and shared memory usage. Each of these is a general, applicable rule for CUDA kernels.\n",
