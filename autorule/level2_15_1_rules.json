  "The kernel uses a 2D grid organization to align with the tensor's logical layout (batch and channels), improving block scheduling efficiency.",
  "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization flags (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling and efficient register usage.",
  "The kernel stores intermediate results (e.g., mean) in shared memory to allow efficient access by all threads after a single load.",
  "The kernel employs templated code to generate specialized implementations for specific data types, enhancing optimization opportunities."
