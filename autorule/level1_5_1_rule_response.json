Both use the same grid/block configuration (256 threads per block), contiguous memory access patterns, and identical tensor handling. There are no structural or optimization differences between them that would justify a performance discrepancy. The observed runtime parity (12.5 ms for both) aligns with this analysis.\n\n**JSON Output:**\n[]",
