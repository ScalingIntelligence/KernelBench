  "The kernel uses a fixed thread block size to optimize occupancy and shared memory usage.",
  "The kernel avoids dynamic block size adjustments, ensuring consistent shared memory allocation and thread utilization.",
  "The kernel's thread block size is chosen to balance shared memory consumption and the number of concurrent blocks per streaming multiprocessor (SM).",
  "The kernel prioritizes higher occupancy by using smaller thread block sizes to allow more active blocks per SM."
