  "The kernel uses a larger tile size to reduce grid launch overhead and improve memory coalescing.",
  "The kernel leverages the read-only data cache using __ldg() for frequently accessed data.",
  "The kernel employs loop unrolling via #pragma unroll to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel utilizes template specialization for tile size to enable compile-time optimizations.",
  "The kernel enforces tensor contiguity and uses __restrict__ qualifiers to optimize memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel is compiled with --use_fast_math to enable aggressive floating-point optimizations."
