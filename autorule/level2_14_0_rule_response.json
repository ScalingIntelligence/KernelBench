  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernels and focus on memory optimization strategies, such as shared memory caching, vectorized operations, and memory coalescing. The block size difference, while mentioned in the reasoning, is not included as a rule because its impact is context-dependent and not universally deterministic. The selected rules emphasize objective, deterministic optimizations applicable across various kernels.",
