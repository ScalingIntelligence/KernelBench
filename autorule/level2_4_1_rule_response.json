Each statement captures a specific optimization or implementation choice that can be objectively verified (e.g., checking compiler flags, inspecting numerical stability techniques, or analyzing device guard usage). These rules are generalizable to other CUDA kernels, as they focus on compiler directives, numerical stability patterns, optimization levels, and API usage patterns.",
