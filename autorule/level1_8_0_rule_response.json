  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively determinable.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses a 4x4 subtile per thread. This means each thread handles multiple elements, which increases arithmetic intensity. So a rule here could be about using subtiling to have each thread compute multiple elements.\n\nNext, the tile size in Kernel 2 is 64 compared to 32 in Kernel 1. A larger tile size reduces the number of iterations over the K dimension. This is a general optimization, so the rule would mention using larger tile sizes to reduce loop iterations.\n\nCoalesced global memory access is achieved in Kernel 2 by having each thread load a contiguous 4x4 block. This leads to full coalescing, which is a standard optimization. The rule here would be about structuring memory access to enable coalesced transactions.\n\nKernel 2 transposes matrix B in shared memory to reduce bank conflicts. This is a specific technique to optimize shared memory access patterns, so the rule would mention transposing matrices in shared memory to avoid conflicts.\n\nThe use of #pragma unroll in loops is highlighted as reducing overhead and improving instruction-level parallelism. This is a common practice, so the rule would involve unrolling loops to reduce instruction overhead.\n\nLastly, the thread block configuration in Kernel 2 (16x16 vs 32x32) is noted for better occupancy. The rule here would relate to choosing thread block dimensions that balance occupancy and resource usage.\n\nI need to ensure these rules are phrased generally without specific numbers. For example, instead of \"4x4 subtile,\" it's \"subtile dimensions.\" Also, avoid mentioning specific kernels (Kernel 1 vs 2) and focus on the techniques used.\n",
