REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's start by analyzing the reasoning provided. The user wants me to extract rule-like statements from the reasoning about why one CUDA kernel is faster than the other. The rules need to be general, objective, and applicable to various kernels.

First, I'll go through the reasoning step by step. The main points mentioned are shared memory tiling, loop unrolling, memory coalescing, specialized kernels via templates, restrict qualifiers, grid configuration, and block dimensions. 

The first key point is the use of shared memory to cache input tiles. This reduces global memory access, which aligns with example 2 given. So a rule here would be about using shared memory tiling.

Next, loop unrolling with pragma directives and template parameters. The reasoning mentions that this allows the compiler to unroll loops, reducing overhead. That's a clear optimization technique, so a rule about loop unrolling with pragma and template parameters.

Memory coalescing is achieved through tiling and 2D block structure. The reasoning states that consecutive memory accesses are coalesced. So a rule about memory coalescing through tiling and block structure.

Specialized kernel variants via switch statements and compile-time constants. The example uses templates for kernel size, etc., allowing the compiler to optimize. So a rule about specialized kernels using compile-time constants.

Restrict qualifiers are mentioned as enabling better optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing. That's another rule.

Grid configuration using 3D grid and 2D blocks to match data structure and improve parallelism. The reasoning highlights this as a factor, so a rule about grid and block dimensions aligning with data structure.

Block sizes that are multiples of warp size (like 16x16=256, which is 8 warps). The example uses 16x16 threads, which is a multiple of 32 (warp size). So a rule about thread block sizes being multiples of warp size.

The reasoning also mentions efficient occupancy due to block structure, but that's more of an effect rather than a rule. The rules should be actionable steps, like using certain block sizes or memory techniques.

Now, compiling these into rule-like statements. Each should be a concise, general statement that can be applied to other kernels. Avoid specifics like 3x3 kernel; instead, generalize.

Check the examples given: they are all general, like using shared memory tiling, thread block multiples of 32, etc.

So the extracted rules would be:

1. The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.
2. The kernel uses loop unrolling via pragma directives and template parameters to reduce loop overhead.
3. The kernel employs memory coalescing through tiling and thread block structure.
4. The kernel uses specialized variants via compile-time constants for kernel parameters.
5. The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable compiler optimizations.
6. The kernel configures grid and block dimensions to align with data structure dimensions.
7. The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).

Wait, the reasoning mentions 16x16 blocks. 16x16 is 256, which is 8 warps. So 256 is a multiple of 32. So that's covered in example 3. So rule 7 is valid.

I need to ensure each rule is a separate, general statement. Let me list them again:

- Shared memory tiling
- Loop unrolling with pragma and templates
- Memory coalescing via tiling and block structure
- Specialized kernels with compile-time constants
- __restrict__ qualifiers
- Grid/block alignment with data structure
- Block sizes as multiples of warp size

These all fit the criteria. Now, check if any are missing. The reasoning also mentions efficient grid configuration (3D grid for batch/channels), but that's covered under grid alignment with data structure. The use of 2D blocks for 2D data is part of that.

So the final list should include these seven rules. Make sure they are phrased as the examples, starting with "The kernel...".
