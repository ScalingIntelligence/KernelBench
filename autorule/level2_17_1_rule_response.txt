REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a larger block size to reduce the number of loop iterations per thread.",
    "The kernel minimizes loop-control overhead by decreasing the number of iterations through increased block size.",
    "The kernel's block size is chosen to optimize memory access patterns by reducing the total number of memory transactions.",
    "The kernel balances loop iteration efficiency against reduction phase overhead by selecting a block size that prioritizes fewer loop iterations."
