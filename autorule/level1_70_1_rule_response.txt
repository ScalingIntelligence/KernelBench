REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses loop unrolling directives (e.g., #pragma unroll) on inner loops to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel checks for invalid loop iterations early and skips subsequent nested loops to reduce redundant computations.",
    "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations such as register reordering and memory access coalescing.",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads per block) to improve GPU occupancy and hardware resource utilization."
