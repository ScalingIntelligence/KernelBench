REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels and trying to figure out why one is faster. The main points mentioned are vectorization using float4, coalesced memory access, and reduced loop overhead.

First, the vectorized memory access with float4. The reasoning states that Kernel 1 uses float4 to load four elements at once, reducing memory transactions. This is a clear optimization technique. So a rule here would be about using vectorized memory accesses like float4.

Next, coalesced memory access patterns. The explanation mentions that Kernel 1's consecutive memory access allows coalescing, while Kernel 2's strided access doesn't. So another rule would be ensuring memory accesses are consecutive for coalescing.

Then, the loop overhead. Kernel 1 processes four elements per loop iteration, reducing the number of iterations. This leads to fewer loop control operations, so a rule about processing multiple elements per loop iteration to reduce overhead.

The other factors like block size and reduction strategies are mentioned as similar, so they don't contribute to the difference. The GELU computation is the same, so no rule there.

So the key rules are vectorization, coalesced access, and loop structure. Need to phrase them as general, applicable rules. Let me check the examples given. The examples are things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, thread block sizes. So the rules should be in a similar vein.

So the rules extracted would be:

1. The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) to reduce the number of memory transactions.
2. The kernel ensures consecutive memory access patterns to enable memory coalescing.
3. The kernel processes multiple elements per loop iteration to reduce loop control overhead.

These are all objective and can be applied to various kernels. They don't mention specific block sizes or problem sizes, so they're general enough.
