REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses single-precision CUDA math functions (e.g., log1pf) instead of double-precision equivalents (e.g., log1p) to avoid unnecessary type conversions and leverage faster single-precision arithmetic.",
    "The kernel avoids implicit type promotion from single-precision (float) to double-precision (double) in mathematical operations to maintain computational efficiency.",
    "The kernel ensures numerical stability in activation functions (e.g., softplus) to prevent overflow/underflow issues that could indirectly affect performance."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernels and focus on precision optimization, type conversion avoidance, and numerical stability.
