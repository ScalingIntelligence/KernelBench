REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a grid configuration that directly maps thread and block indices to output tensor dimensions, avoiding integer division and modulus operations for index calculations.",
    "The kernel organizes threads into 2D blocks to process spatially adjacent output elements, improving spatial locality for input memory accesses.",
    "The kernel's thread block dimensions are chosen to ensure consecutive threads process contiguous memory addresses in the output tensor, enabling coalesced writes.",
    "The kernel minimizes computational overhead by deriving output indices directly from block/thread indices rather than decomposing a linear index."
