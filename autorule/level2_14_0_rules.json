  "The kernel uses shared memory to cache data reused across all threads in the block, reducing global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel loads reused data into shared memory once per block instead of per thread, amortizing global memory access costs.",
  "The kernel employs vectorized memory operations (e.g., float4) to improve global memory access efficiency.",
  "The kernel optimizes memory coalescing by accessing contiguous global memory locations during data loading into shared memory."
