  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the analysis of the two CUDA kernels. These statements capture general optimization strategies that can be applied to other CUDA kernels. Key points include the use of `__restrict__` qualifiers and compiler flags to improve memory access patterns, avoiding warp divergence by using single-threaded reductions with unrolled loops, and leveraging pragmas to eliminate loop overhead. These rules are objective and can be deterministically verified by examining kernel code and compiler settings.",
  "reasoning_trace": "[\n    \"The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer parameters to enable better compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.\",\n    \"The kernel enables the --restrict compiler flag to treat all pointers as restricted, enhancing memory access optimizations.\",\n    \"The kernel performs final reduction using a single thread with an unrolled loop instead of warp-level shuffle operations to avoid warp execution divergence.\",\n    \"The kernel applies the #pragma unroll directive to eliminate loop overhead in reduction phases.\",\n    \"The kernel avoids warp execution divergence during reduction by limiting active threads to a single thread for summation instead of partial warp participation.\"\n]\n",
