  "The kernel uses vectorized data types (e.g., uchar4) for direct component access to reduce bitwise operations during mask processing.",
  "The kernel avoids bitwise operations for mask value extraction by leveraging structured vector data types.",
  "The kernel supports arbitrary tensor dimensions and memory layouts, including both contiguous and non-contiguous cases.",
  "The kernel includes conditional handling for non-vectorized paths to process remaining elements when dimensions are not multiples of the vector size.",
  "The kernel imposes fewer constraints on input tensor dimensions (e.g., no requirement for divisibility by a specific vector size)."
