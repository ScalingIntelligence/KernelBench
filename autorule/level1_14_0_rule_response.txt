REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel accesses matrix elements in a coalesced manner by ensuring consecutive threads access contiguous memory locations for critical matrix operands.",
    "The kernel avoids non-coalesced memory access patterns by aligning thread indexing with the memory layout of input matrices.",
    "The kernel maps thread indices to matrix dimensions such that consecutive threads access contiguous elements in frequently accessed matrices.",
    "The kernel minimizes strided memory accesses by ensuring thread-block/grid dimensions align with the dominant access pattern of key operands."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the analysis. These rules focus on memory coalescing patterns, thread indexing alignment with memory layouts, and minimization of strided accesses - all critical factors for CUDA kernel performance. The rules are:  
1. Explicit emphasis on coalesced memory access patterns  
2. Thread indexing alignment with memory layouts to enable coalescing  
3. Thread-to-data mapping that preserves memory locality  
4. Block/grid configuration to support dominant access patterns  

These rules are generalizable to other CUDA kernels and can be objectively verified by examining memory access patterns and thread indexing strategies.
