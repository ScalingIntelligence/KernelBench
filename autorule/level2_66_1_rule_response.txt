REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses warp-level shuffle instructions for reductions instead of shared memory.",
    "The kernel employs a custom random number generator without per-thread state initialization.",
    "The kernel's loop structure ensures consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses for better coalescing.",
    "The kernel is compiled with compiler flags enabling fast math optimizations.",
    "The kernel avoids using shared memory for reductions to improve occupancy.",
    "The kernel uses a deterministic per-element seed for random number generation to enable recomputation without state storage."

ANSWER:


The JSON array lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement captures a distinct optimization or design choice in Kernel 2 that contributes to its performance advantage over Kernel 1. These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels in general, focusing on aspects like RNG efficiency, memory access patterns, reduction strategies, compiler optimizations, and resource management.
