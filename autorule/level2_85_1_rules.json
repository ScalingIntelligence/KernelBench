  "The kernel fuses multiple operations (scaling, max pooling, and clamping) into a single kernel to reduce kernel launch overhead and intermediate memory accesses.",
  "The kernel uses shared memory to store frequently accessed parameters (e.g., scale) once per block, reducing global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel employs a thread block configuration that directly maps to output dimensions (1, H_out, W_out) to improve memory coalescing and reduce thread divergence.",
  "The kernel leverages fixed-size operations (e.g., 4x4 pooling window) to enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling.",
  "The kernel avoids intermediate global memory writes by applying operations (e.g., scaling) during computation rather than storing and reloading results.",
  "The kernel utilizes optimized third-party implementations (e.g., PyTorch's GroupNorm) instead of custom implementations for critical operations.",
  "The kernel organizes thread blocks to process one output element per thread, improving occupancy and reducing redundant computation."
