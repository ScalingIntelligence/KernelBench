These statements focus on the key optimization strategies in Kernel 2, such as fixed block sizes, occupancy optimization, and shared memory management, which are generalizable to CUDA kernel design. The rules avoid referencing specific kernels (e.g., \"softmax_tanh_scale\") to maintain generality.",
