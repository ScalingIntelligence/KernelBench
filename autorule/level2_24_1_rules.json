  "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration instead of a multi-dimensional grid for more efficient block scheduling.",
  "The kernel avoids multi-dimensional grid index calculations, reducing computational overhead in block index derivation.",
  "The kernel's grid configuration may improve spatial locality in L2 cache utilization for input data access."
