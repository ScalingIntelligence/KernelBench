REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) to load multiple elements in a single transaction.",
    "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration with thread block sizes that are multiples of the warp size (32) to ensure full warp utilization.",
    "The kernel unrolls loops to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel ensures memory coalescing by organizing thread indices to access contiguous memory locations across a warp.",
    "The kernel uses the __restrict__ keyword to enable compiler optimizations by guaranteeing no pointer aliasing."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and include:  
1. **Vectorized memory accesses** to reduce global memory transactions.  
2. **1D grid configuration** with warp-aligned block sizes for better occupancy.  
3. **Loop unrolling** to minimize overhead.  
4. **Memory coalescing** via thread index organization.  
5. **Use of `__restrict__`** for compiler optimizations.  

Each rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.
