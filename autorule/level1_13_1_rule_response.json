  "response": "\n\nThe provided reasoning highlights several factors contributing to the performance difference between the two kernels. The key rule-like statements derived from this analysis are:\n\n1. **Smaller tile size reducing shared memory usage** - This allows more blocks to be active per SM, improving occupancy.\n2. **Thread block size optimization for occupancy** - Smaller blocks fit within resource constraints, enabling more concurrent blocks.\n3. **Coalesced global memory access patterns** - Both kernels achieve this through proper thread indexing and tile dimensions.\n4. **Avoidance of shared memory bank conflicts** - Achieved through proper data layout and access patterns.\n\nThese rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and can be objectively verified through shared memory usage calculations, occupancy calculators, and memory access pattern analysis.",
