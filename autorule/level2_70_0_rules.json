  "The kernel avoids vectorized memory accesses which can cause misalignment and require scalar fallback handling.",
  "The kernel uses a per-thread processing strategy that reduces register pressure, enabling higher occupancy.",
  "The kernel processes elements without requiring alignment constraints, ensuring consistent memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel minimizes tail effects by processing elements individually, avoiding underutilized threads from residual elements."
