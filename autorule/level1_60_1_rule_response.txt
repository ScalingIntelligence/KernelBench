ANSWER:


The JSON array contains three rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

1. **Early Spatial Validity Checks**: Kernel 1 validates spatial coordinates (e.g., `w_in`, `h_in`) at outer loop levels (`kw`, `kh`), allowing it to skip entire inner loops (`kh`/`kd` or `kd`) when invalid positions are detected. This reduces redundant iterations compared to Kernel 2, which checks all spatial dimensions in the innermost loop.

2. **Redundant Iteration Avoidance**: By terminating loops early for invalid spatial positions, Kernel 1 avoids unnecessary computations in inner loops. This is critical for kernels with padding or edge cases where many kernel positions fall outside valid input boundaries.

3. **Condition Check Optimization**: Kernel 1 minimizes branch divergence in performance-critical inner loops by resolving spatial validity earlier in the execution flow. This contrasts with Kernel 2, which incurs overhead from repeated condition checks in the innermost loop, even when outer dimensions (e.g., `iw`) are already invalid.

These rules generalize to CUDA kernels involving nested loops with boundary conditions (e.g., convolutions, pooling). Optimizing loop termination and condition check placement can significantly impact performance by reducing computational overhead and improving warp efficiency.
