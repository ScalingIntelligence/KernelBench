These statements focus on: \n\n1. **Grid Organization** - Multi-dimensional grid structure for spatial locality\n2. **Memory Coalescing** - Contiguous memory access patterns via spatial grouping\n3. **Indexing Efficiency** - Direct use of block/thread indices over complex unraveling\n4. **Cache Utilization** - Memory-aligned tensor access patterns\n5. **Register Efficiency** - Reduced arithmetic operations for index calculation\n\nThese rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.",
