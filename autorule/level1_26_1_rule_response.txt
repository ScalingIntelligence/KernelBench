REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided to extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively verifiable.

First, the analysis mentions that Kernel 2 uses the tanh function, which is faster than the erf function used in Kernel 1. This implies a general rule about the choice of transcendental functions affecting performance. So a rule could be: "The kernel uses tanh instead of erf for lower-latency computation."

Next, the reasoning points out that Kernel 2's polynomial terms allow the compiler to use Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) instructions. FMA optimization is a common CUDA practice, leading to a rule like: "The kernel's arithmetic operations are optimized through fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions."

Additionally, the polynomial in Kernel 2 (xÂ³ term) is mentioned to expose more independent operations that can be pipelined. This relates to instruction-level parallelism, so another rule could be: "The kernel exposes independent arithmetic operations for better instruction-level parallelism."

The analysis also notes that the tanh-based approach benefits from CUDA's hardware-accelerated functions. This suggests a rule about leveraging hardware acceleration for certain functions: "The kernel utilizes hardware-accelerated transcendental functions."

I need to ensure these rules are general and not specific to GELU. For example, mentioning tanh vs. erf is specific, but the broader idea is using lower-latency functions. However, the example given in the problem includes specific functions like erf and tanh in the examples. Wait, the examples provided by the user (e.g., Example 1 about operator fusion) are specific. So maybe including the specific functions is acceptable as they are objective.

But the user wants rules applicable to various CUDA kernels. So perhaps rephrasing to focus on the choice of functions based on their latency. For example: "The kernel selects transcendental functions with lower intrinsic latency (e.g., tanh over erf)."

Alternatively, the original reasoning states: "The tanhf approximation benefits from CUDA's aggressive FMA optimization for such patterns." This could translate to a rule about leveraging FMA opportunities in arithmetic operations.

Putting it all together, the extracted rules would be:

1. The kernel uses tanh instead of erf for lower-latency computation.
2. The kernel's arithmetic operations are optimized through fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions.
3. The kernel exposes independent arithmetic operations for better instruction-level parallelism.
4. The kernel utilizes hardware-accelerated transcendental functions.

But need to check if these are rule-like and objective. For example, "uses tanh instead of erf" is specific but objective. However, the user's examples include specific techniques like shared memory tiling. So including specific functions might be acceptable.

Another point from the reasoning: "the compiler to fuse operations using FMA" implies that the kernel's code structure allows such optimizations, which is a general rule. So the second rule about FMA optimization is valid.

The instruction-level parallelism point is about independent operations, which is a general optimization strategy.

The hardware-accelerated functions point is also general, as CUDA has certain functions that are optimized on hardware.

So the final list would include these four rules, but maybe some can be merged or rephrased for generality.

Wait, the fourth rule about hardware-accelerated functions is covered by the first rule (tanh is hardware-accelerated and lower latency). Maybe combining them.

Alternatively, the key points are:

- Prefer lower-latency transcendental functions (tanh over erf).
- Structure arithmetic to enable FMA optimization.
- Expose independent operations for instruction-level parallelism.

So the JSON array would be:

[
  "The kernel uses lower-latency transcendental functions (e.g., tanh instead of erf).",
  "The kernel's arithmetic operations are structured to enable fused multiply-add (FMA) optimization.",
  "The kernel exposes independent arithmetic operations to improve instruction-level parallelism."
]

These are general and applicable to various kernels. The mention of tanh and erf is in parentheses as an example, keeping the rule general but specific enough.


ANSWER:


[
  "The kernel uses lower-latency transcendental functions (e.g., tanh instead of erf).",
  "The kernel's arithmetic operations are structured to enable fused multiply-add (FMA) optimization.",
  "The kernel exposes independent arithmetic operations to improve instruction-level parallelism."
]
