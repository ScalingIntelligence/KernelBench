  "The kernel uses CUDA's __expf intrinsic for faster approximate exponential calculations instead of the standard expf function.",
  "The kernel employs parallel thread-level summation of warp reduction results to reduce computation time.",
  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to optimize global memory bandwidth utilization.",
  "The kernel organizes memory access patterns to ensure contiguous memory operations for better coalescing.",
  "The kernel compiles with -O3 optimization flag to enable aggressive scalar optimizations."
