REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes to reduce loop iterations per thread.",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes to improve memory coalescing by increasing contiguous memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes to increase the number of active warps per block, improving occupancy and latency hiding."

ANSWER:


The analysis identifies several key factors contributing to Kernel 2's performance advantage, which can be generalized into these rule-like statements:

1. **Block Size Multiples of Warp Size**  
   Both kernels follow this rule, but the observation reinforces its importance for GPU efficiency.

2. **Larger Blocks Reduce Loop Overhead**  
   Explicitly connects block size selection with loop iteration count optimization.

3. **Memory Coalescing Through Block Sizing**  
   Highlights how block size influences memory access patterns independent of specific data structures.

4. **Warp Quantity for Occupancy**  
   Generalizes the relationship between block size, warp count per block, and occupancy - a fundamental CUDA optimization principle.

These rules are:  
- Architecture-agnostic (apply to any CUDA-capable GPU)  
- Actionable (guide kernel design decisions)  
- Verifiable (can check block size/loop stride/warp count through code inspection)  
- Deterministic (produce clear true/false assessments)
