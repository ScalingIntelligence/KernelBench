REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a grid-stride loop to process multiple elements per thread, improving occupancy and thread utilization.",
    "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (512) to increase the number of active warps per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).",
    "The kernel caps the grid size to a fixed maximum (e.g., 1024) to reduce scheduling overhead and improve resource utilization.",
    "The kernel avoids using __ldg() for global memory access when data reuse is minimal, relying on coalesced memory access patterns instead."
