REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses loop unrolling for small kernel sizes to eliminate loop overhead.",
    "The kernel uses a 1D grid layout to enable contiguous memory access patterns for global memory.",
    "The kernel avoids shared memory usage for small kernel sizes, relying on coalesced global memory access instead.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel uses compiler flags that enable aggressive optimizations such as -O3 and -use_fast_math.",
    "The kernel employs fused dimension calculations to reduce index computation overhead.",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that allow fewer registers per thread, increasing occupancy.",
    "The kernel is optimized for specific kernel size constraints (e.g., ≤3x3) through conditional unrolling."
