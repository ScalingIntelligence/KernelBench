  "The kernel uses vectorized memory operations (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel loads frequently accessed data (e.g., bias) into shared memory to minimize global memory access.",
  "The kernel structures its grid to ensure contiguous, coalesced global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel precomputes reciprocal values to replace division operations with multiplication.",
  "The kernel processes data in vectorized chunks followed by a scalar tail to handle non-aligned elements.",
  "The kernel minimizes redundant arithmetic operations by simplifying clamp/scale steps.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that align with vectorized memory access patterns (e.g., multiples of 4 for float4)."
