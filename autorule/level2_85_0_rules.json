  "The kernel minimizes index calculations by linearizing multi-dimensional indices into a single loop variable.",
  "The kernel enables better compiler optimizations such as loop unrolling through simplified loop structures.",
  "The kernel reduces register pressure by simplifying address computation in memory access patterns."
