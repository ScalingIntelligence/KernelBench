  "The kernel uses thread block and grid dimensions that result in coalesced writes to the output matrix by mapping consecutive threads to contiguous memory addresses.",
  "The kernel avoids strided global memory writes by ensuring that consecutive threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations for the output matrix.",
  "The kernel prioritizes coalesced write operations over read operations when trade-offs exist between read and write memory access patterns."
