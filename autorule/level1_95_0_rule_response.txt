REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a single kernel launch to avoid intermediate global memory writes and additional kernel launch overhead.",
    "The kernel performs reductions (e.g., max, sum) within shared memory at the block level to minimize global memory interactions.",
    "The kernel uses coalesced memory access patterns for contiguous data within thread blocks to leverage full memory bandwidth without explicit vectorization.",
    "The kernel avoids splitting computations into multiple kernels to prevent redundant global memory traffic from intermediate results.",
    "The kernel uses atomic operations on global memory with minimal contention (e.g., per-block atomicAdd) instead of intermediate global memory storage followed by summation.",
    "The kernel processes each sample in a dedicated thread block to localize memory access and computation, reducing cross-block dependencies."
