REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a numerically efficient approximation (tanh-based) for the GELU activation instead of the erf-based version.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers for input and output pointers to enable memory access optimizations by the compiler.",
    "The kernel is compiled with -O3 optimization level for aggressive loop unrolling and inlining.",
    "The kernel enables fused multiply-add (FMAD) operations via the --fmad=true compiler flag.",
    "The kernel precomputes constants (e.g., sqrt_2_over_pi, gelu_coeff) for use in fast memory regions."
