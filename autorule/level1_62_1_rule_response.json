Objective - Can be verified by examining memory types (shared/global) and compiler directives\n2. Deterministic - Presence of specific CUDA features like restrict qualifiers or loop unrolling pragmas can be definitively checked\n3. Generalizable - Applicable to various CUDA kernels beyond just convolution operations\n4. Actionable - Provide clear optimization strategies for GPU programmers\n\nEach rule corresponds to a distinct optimization technique that can be independently analyzed and applied to other kernels.",
