  "The kernel uses a 2D thread block structure to enable memory coalescing for contiguous memory accesses.",
  "The kernel organizes threads to process spatially close output elements, improving spatial locality and cache utilization.",
  "The kernel avoids division and modulus operations for index calculations, reducing computational overhead.",
  "The kernel groups threads by output channel to enhance weight reuse through caching.",
  "The kernel uses thread block dimensions that align with the data layout (e.g., 2D blocks for 2D output grids)."
