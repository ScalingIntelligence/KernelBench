REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel fuses multiple operations into a single kernel to eliminate intermediate global memory writes and reads.",
    "The kernel avoids materializing intermediate tensors in global memory by keeping values in shared memory or registers.",
    "The kernel parallelizes processing across independent dimensions (e.g., channels) using separate thread blocks instead of sequential loops.",
    "The kernel uses atomic operations for cross-thread-block reductions when contention is expected to be low (e.g., per-batch accumulation across channels).",
    "The kernel reduces global memory bandwidth usage by minimizing data transfer between kernel stages.",
    "The kernel optimizes thread block grid dimensions to align with parallelizable dimensions of the problem (e.g., batch and channels)."
