  "The kernel uses coalesced global memory access for loading matrix B into shared memory.",
  "The kernel avoids non-coalesced global memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses during shared memory loading.",
  "The kernel minimizes shared memory bank conflicts during computation by aligning thread access patterns with shared memory bank organization."
