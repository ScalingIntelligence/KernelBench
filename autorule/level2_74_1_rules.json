  "The kernel uses branchless operations (e.g., fmaxf) instead of ternary operators to avoid warp divergence.",
  "The kernel hardcodes constant values (e.g., 0.2f) to enable compile-time optimizations instead of passing them as runtime parameters.",
  "The kernel specializes for a specific data type (e.g., float) instead of using templated types to enable hardware-specific optimizations.",
  "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization flags (e.g., -O3) for CUDA code to improve instruction scheduling and register allocation."
