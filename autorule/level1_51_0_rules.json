  "The kernel uses the __ldg intrinsic for read-only data cache loads to improve memory throughput.",
  "The kernel unrolls loops (e.g., 4x for DIM=1, 8x for DIM=2) to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel optimizes grid/block configurations to maximize memory coalescing for contiguous data access.",
  "The kernel processes multiple elements per loop iteration to exploit memory-level parallelism and hide latency."
