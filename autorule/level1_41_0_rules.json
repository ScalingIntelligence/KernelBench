  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ qualifier on input and output pointers to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel is compiled with the -use_fast_math flag, enabling faster mathematical operations at the expense of some precision.",
  "The kernel uses a thread block size that is a power of two (e.g., 512), which can improve occupancy and memory coalescing on GPUs.",
  "The kernel employs a grid-stride loop pattern to handle arbitrary input sizes robustly and improve GPU utilization."
