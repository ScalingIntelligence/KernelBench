  "The kernel precomputes batch normalization parameters (scale and shift) during evaluation mode to avoid recomputation in each forward pass.",
  "The kernel separates training and inference paths to optimize for specific operations in each mode.",
  "The kernel uses precomputed buffers for parameters to reduce Python/CUDA context switching and kernel launch overhead.",
  "The kernel avoids recalculating parameters (e.g., inverse standard deviation, scale, shift) on-the-fly during inference."
