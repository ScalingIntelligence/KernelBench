  "The kernel checks spatial validity (e.g., input boundaries) at outer loop levels to skip unnecessary inner loop iterations.",
  "The kernel avoids redundant inner loop iterations by early termination when invalid spatial positions are detected in outer loops.",
  "The kernel minimizes condition checks in innermost loops by validating spatial coordinates at higher loop levels where possible."
