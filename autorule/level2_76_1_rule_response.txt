    "The kernel uses separate input and output buffers to allow overlapping of memory reads and writes.",
    "The kernel avoids in-place operations to prevent read-modify-write dependencies that serialize memory operations.",
    "The kernel writes to a new memory region to enable write-combining optimizations and reduce cache thrashing."
