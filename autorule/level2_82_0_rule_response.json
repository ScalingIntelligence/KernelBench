  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided to extract the rule-like statements. The user wants general CUDA kernel optimization rules that are objective and deterministic.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions Kernel 2 fuses tanh, scale, bias, and max pool into a single kernel. This points to operator fusion beyond just a few steps. So a rule could be about fusing multiple operations into one kernel to reduce launches.\n\nNext, the memory access part. Kernel 2 avoids writing intermediate results to global memory by computing on-the-fly and using registers. That's about minimizing global memory access by keeping intermediates in registers or shared memory.\n\nThen, the grid dimensions: Kernel 2 uses fewer threads corresponding to the output size, which is more efficient. So thread count aligned with output dimensions rather than input, which might relate to efficient grid sizing.\n\nAlso, data reuse in registers during max pooling without redundant computation. That's about reusing data within threads to avoid recomputation.\n\nLooking at the examples given, like shared memory tiling or warp size multiples, the extracted rules should be similarly general. The key points from the reasoning are fusion, reduced global memory via registers, grid dimensions based on output, and data reuse without recomputation.\n\nI need to phrase these as rules. Let me check each point:\n\n1. Fusing multiple operations (four in this case) into a single kernel. So the rule is about operator fusion across multiple steps.\n\n2. Avoiding intermediate global memory writes by using registers. The rule would mention using registers to hold intermediates, reducing global memory traffic.\n\n3. Launching threads based on output tensor size rather than input. That's a grid dimension strategy, so the rule could be about grid dimensions matching output size.\n\n4. Computing values on-the-fly during another operation (max pooling here) to avoid recomputation. This is about combining computation within a single step to prevent redundant work.\n\nThese points are all generalizable. Now, phrasing them as rules:\n\n- The kernel fuses multiple operations (tanh, scaling, bias addition, max pooling) into a single kernel launch.\n- The kernel computes intermediate values on-the-fly and retains them in registers to minimize global memory access.\n- The kernel launches threads based on the output tensor dimensions rather than the input tensor dimensions.\n- The kernel avoids redundant computation by combining operations in a single processing step.\n\nI need to ensure these are objective and applicable to various kernels. The second point could be generalized to using registers instead of global memory for intermediates. The fourth point might be part of operator fusion, but the reasoning emphasizes avoiding recomputation, so maybe a separate rule about on-the-fly computation.\n\nChecking the examples again, the user's examples are more about techniques (shared memory tiling, warp size). So the rules here should mirror that. Let me adjust:\n\n- \"The kernel fuses multiple consecutive operations into a single kernel launch.\" (Covers the fusion beyond just two ops)\n- \"The kernel retains intermediate results in registers instead of global memory to reduce memory traffic.\" (Specific about registers)\n- \"The kernel configures grid dimensions based on the output tensor size to optimize thread count.\" (Grid strategy)\n- \"The kernel computes intermediate values on-the-fly during subsequent operations to avoid redundant computation.\" (On-the-fly computation)\n\nThese are all objective and can be checked in code. The answer should be a JSON array of such statements.\n",
