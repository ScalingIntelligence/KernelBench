  "The kernel uses a larger block size (1024 threads) to improve instruction-level parallelism and reduce scheduling overhead.",
  "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage (4KB per block) to allow higher occupancy and more concurrent blocks per SM.",
  "The kernel fuses computations (GELU and normalization) in a single pass without intermediate storage in shared memory.",
  "The kernel uses a simpler block-level reduction pattern that works better with its memory access pattern.",
  "The kernel employs a faster mathematical approximation (sigmoid) for activation functions when combined with fast math compiler flags."
