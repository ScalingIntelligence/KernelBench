  "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization flags (e.g., -O3) enabling aggressive loop unrolling and instruction scheduling.",
  "The kernel reduces loop overhead by unrolling inner loops during compilation optimizations.",
  "The kernel utilizes compiler optimizations to enhance register allocation and reduce memory spills."
