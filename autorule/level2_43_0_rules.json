  "The kernel fuses multiple operations (max pooling, logsumexp, ReLU) into a single kernel to reduce global memory accesses and kernel launches.",
  "The kernel processes spatial windows (e.g., 2x2x2) contiguously to enable coalesced memory access and improve locality.",
  "The kernel avoids intermediate global memory writes by fusing operations that would otherwise require separate data storage.",
  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ qualifier to enable compiler optimizations for memory access patterns.",
  "The kernel reduces global memory traffic by eliminating redundant data transfers between separate operations."
