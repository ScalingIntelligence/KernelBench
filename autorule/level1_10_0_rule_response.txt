REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a tile size that minimizes shared memory bank conflicts during matrix multiplication.",
    "The kernel selects a tile size that allows more concurrent blocks per streaming multiprocessor (SM) by using less shared memory per block.",
    "The kernel uses a thread block size that balances occupancy and shared memory usage, avoiding maximum thread count per block limitations.",
    "The kernel avoids unrolling loops with large iteration counts to reduce register pressure and improve occupancy.",
    "The kernel organizes shared memory accesses to ensure threads within a warp access distinct memory banks, preventing bank conflicts."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about the performance difference between the two kernels. These rules focus on tile size selection to avoid bank conflicts, shared memory usage optimization for occupancy, thread block size configuration, loop unrolling impact on register pressure, and shared memory access patterns. Each statement is general enough to apply to CUDA kernels beyond this specific example and can be objectively verified through code inspection or profiling tools.
