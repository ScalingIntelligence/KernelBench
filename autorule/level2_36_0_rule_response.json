  "response": "\n\nHere is the analysis of the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:\n\n1. **Separation of Reduction and Element-Wise Operations**  \n   Kernel 1 splits the workload into two kernels: one for reductions (min/sum) and another for GELU + bias. This ensures full thread utilization during the element-wise phase, unlike Kernel 2, where only one thread per block computes GELU.\n\n2. **Thread Utilization in Element-Wise Operations**  \n   Kernel 1\u2019s GELU kernel uses all threads for parallel computation, while Kernel 2 serializes GELU within a block (only thread 0 active). This highlights the importance of avoiding thread underutilization in fused kernels.\n\n3. **Block Size Optimization**  \n   Kernel 1 uses larger block sizes (256 threads) for better SM occupancy, whereas Kernel 2\u2019s block size depends on problem-specific dimensions (e.g., H=128), leading to smaller blocks and lower occupancy.\n\n4. **Avoiding Fusion-Induced Underutilization**  \n   While Kernel 2 fuses operations to reduce global memory traffic, the severe thread underutilization during GELU outweighs the memory savings. This emphasizes that fusion is not always beneficial if it sacrifices parallelism.\n\n5. **Balancing Fusion and Parallelism**  \n   The tradeoff between fusion (reducing memory operations) and thread utilization is critical. Kernel 1 prioritizes parallelism over fusion, demonstrating that split kernels can outperform fused ones when thread utilization is compromised.",
