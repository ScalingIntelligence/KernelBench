  "The kernel uses compiler flags such as -O3 and --use_fast_math to enable aggressive optimizations and approximate math functions.",
  "The kernel employs numerically stable operations (e.g., log1pf(expf(x))) to avoid precision loss and enable better compiler optimization.",
  "The kernel ensures tensor contiguity checks to prevent performance penalties from strided data access.",
  "The kernel structures operations into device functions that may be inlined or optimized by the compiler."
