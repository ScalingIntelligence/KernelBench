  "The kernel uses specialized implementations for specific reduction dimensions to eliminate branching and enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel organizes the grid in a 2D structure to ensure contiguous memory accesses for each reduction step, enabling full coalescing of global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel groups threads by batch index to improve cache reuse by targeting data from the same batch repeatedly.",
  "The kernel aligns grid configuration with problem dimensions to reduce index-mapping overhead and improve thread utilization across SMs."
