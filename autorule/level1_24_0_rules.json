  "The kernel uses warp shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) for intra-warp reductions instead of shared memory-based tree reductions.",
  "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage to allow higher occupancy by reducing per-block shared memory consumption.",
  "The kernel employs a two-phase reduction strategy (warp-level followed by cross-warp) to minimize thread divergence and synchronization overhead.",
  "The kernel uses compiler flags enabling fast math operations (e.g., -use_fast_math) for approximate but faster mathematical functions.",
  "The kernel processes final reduction steps with a single warp to reduce the number of active threads and synchronization requirements.",
  "The kernel avoids thread underutilization by keeping all threads active during warp-level operations instead of deactivating them progressively."
