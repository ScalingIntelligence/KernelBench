REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory operations (e.g., float4) to load/store multiple elements per transaction.",
    "The kernel employs register blocking to compute multiple output elements per thread, increasing arithmetic intensity.",
    "The kernel configures thread block sizes to optimize occupancy and latency hiding (e.g., smaller blocks for higher concurrency).",
    "The kernel ensures memory access patterns are coalesced for both global and shared memory.",
    "The kernel unrolls inner loops to reduce instruction overhead and improve instruction scheduling.",
    "The kernel handles boundary conditions with bulk vector operations and minimal branching in common cases."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernels and focus on optimizations such as vectorized memory operations, register blocking, thread configuration for occupancy, memory coalescing, loop unrolling, and efficient boundary handling. Each statement is objective and can be applied to evaluate or design other CUDA kernels.
