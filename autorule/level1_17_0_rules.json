  "The kernel uses register blocking to increase arithmetic intensity and reduce global memory writes.",
  "The kernel ensures coalesced global memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.",
  "The kernel transposes matrices in shared memory to enable conflict-free access patterns during computation.",
  "The kernel employs larger tile sizes for output matrices to increase data reuse from shared memory.",
  "The kernel utilizes loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel is specialized for specific data types and tile sizes to allow better compiler optimization."
