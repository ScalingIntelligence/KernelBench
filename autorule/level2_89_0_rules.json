  "The kernel loads all channel data for a spatial position into registers once and reuses it across multiple operations to reduce global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel stores frequently accessed parameters in shared memory to minimize global memory latency.",
  "The kernel uses thread-block mappings and indexing that enable coalesced global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.",
  "The kernel reduces redundant global memory reads by reusing data loaded into registers for subsequent computations instead of re-reading from global memory multiple times."
