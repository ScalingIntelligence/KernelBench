REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a thread block size that optimizes occupancy by balancing register usage and the number of concurrent blocks per SM.",
    "The kernel selects a thread block size that is a multiple of the warp size (32) but smaller to allow more blocks per SM for better load balancing.",
    "The kernel's thread block size is chosen to reduce register pressure, enabling higher occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks on each SM.",
    "The kernel uses a thread block size that facilitates finer-grained load distribution across SMs, improving utilization on GPUs with many SMs."
