  "The kernel precomputes valid loop iteration ranges to minimize bounds checks and reduce loop iterations.",
  "The kernel uses fused dimensions and precomputed offsets to reduce arithmetic operations in index calculations.",
  "The kernel employs grid-stride looping for better load balancing and resource utilization.",
  "The kernel configures thread blocks with higher thread counts (e.g., 512 vs 256) to improve GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel utilizes the __ldg intrinsic for read-only memory access to leverage the read-only data cache.",
  "The kernel minimizes conditional branches in inner loops by preprocessing valid iteration ranges.",
  "The kernel reduces expensive division/mod operations through fused dimension calculations."
