REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel places scalar parameters immediately after input pointers to improve memory alignment and packing efficiency.",
    "The kernel groups scalar parameters together in the argument list to reduce parameter buffer overhead.",
    "The kernel orders parameters to allow earlier loading of frequently accessed scalars into registers, reducing register pressure."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules focus on parameter ordering, alignment, and register usage optimizations that can be generalized to other CUDA kernels. The rules emphasize how parameter arrangement affects memory efficiency and compiler optimizations, which are objectively verifiable through analysis of kernel argument layouts and compiler-generated PTX/assembly code.
