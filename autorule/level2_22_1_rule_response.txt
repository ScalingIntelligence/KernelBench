REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel fuses multiple operations into a single kernel launch to reduce kernel launch overhead.",
    "The kernel retains intermediate results in shared memory or registers instead of writing them to global memory between operations.",
    "The kernel minimizes global memory transactions by avoiding intermediate writes and subsequent reads between separate kernel executions.",
    "The kernel utilizes shared memory for parallel reductions within the same kernel to avoid global memory synchronization between steps.",
    "The kernel employs coalesced memory access patterns during element processing to improve memory throughput.",
    "The kernel optimizes compute density by reusing intermediate values across fused operations.",
    "The kernel configures thread blocks per batch element to improve SM workload balance and reduce scheduling overhead."

Here is the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

These rules are objective, deterministic, and generalizable to other CUDA kernels. They focus on fusion, memory management, parallelism, and resource utilization.
