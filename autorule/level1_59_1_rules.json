  "The kernel restricts convolution parameters to specific values (stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1) to eliminate complex index calculations",
  "The kernel avoids conditional checks for input boundary conditions by ensuring valid padding and output dimension calculations",
  "The kernel separates bias addition from the main convolution operation",
  "The kernel uses simplified index calculations for input/weight tensors that improve memory coalescing",
  "The kernel minimizes register pressure through reduced variable usage and simpler computation logic",
  "The kernel leverages compile-time constant parameters (when applicable) to enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling"
