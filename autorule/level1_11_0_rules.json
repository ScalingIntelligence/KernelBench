  "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) to load multiple elements in a single transaction.",
  "The kernel uses a 1D grid configuration with thread block sizes that are multiples of the warp size (32) to ensure full warp utilization.",
  "The kernel unrolls loops to reduce loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel ensures memory coalescing by organizing thread indices to access contiguous memory locations across a warp.",
  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ keyword to enable compiler optimizations by guaranteeing no pointer aliasing."
