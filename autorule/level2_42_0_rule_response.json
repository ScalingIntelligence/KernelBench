  "response": "\n\nThe two CUDA kernels provided are **functionally identical**, with no observable differences in their implementation. Both kernels use the same strategies for:\n\n1. **Vectorized Memory Access**: Using `float4` for coalesced memory reads in `compute_means_bias_kernel`.\n2. **Block-Level Reductions**: Shared memory reductions for summing channel values.\n3. **Warp-Level Reductions**: Efficient warp shuffles for max/exp/sum operations in `logsumexp_scale_kernel`.\n4. **Kernel Launch Configurations**: Identical block/grid dimensions and shared memory allocation.\n\nThe **0.1 ms runtime difference** (28.7 ms vs 28.8 ms) is likely due to **benchmarking noise** (e.g., GPU thermal state, background processes) rather than algorithmic differences. For meaningful optimization, focus on high-level strategies like kernel fusion or memory access patterns.",
