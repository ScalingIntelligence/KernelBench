  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ qualifier on input and output pointers to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel is compiled with the -O3 optimization level for CUDA code to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel defines constants as preprocessor macros to allow compile-time constant propagation and expression simplification.",
  "The kernel ensures input tensors are contiguous to enable memory coalescing and efficient memory access."
