REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
    "The kernel performs arithmetic operations in an order that allows compiler optimizations for instruction fusion.",
    "The kernel minimizes register usage by avoiding unnecessary intermediate variables."

ANSWER:


The provided JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the analysis of the two CUDA kernels. These rules reflect general optimizations applicable to CUDA programming, such as using thread block sizes aligned with warp size, enabling compiler optimizations through operation ordering, and reducing register pressure by simplifying variable usage. The rules are formulated to be objective and deterministic for broader applicability.
