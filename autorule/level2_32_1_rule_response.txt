REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking for rule-like statements based on the reasoning provided. The reasoning points out that the two kernels are identical, so there's no actual difference in their implementation. The examples given in the problem show things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, and thread block sizes.

Looking at the reasoning, the assistant notes that both kernels use the same memory access pattern (NCHW with coalesced accesses via __ldg), same thread block configuration (256 threads), same math optimizations (-use_fast_math), same loops and reductions, etc. But since they're identical, there's no rule-like difference to extract. The assistant even mentions that if there were differences, they might be in areas like memory access patterns or thread block organization, but those aren't present here.

So, the key points here are that the kernels are the same in all aspects mentioned. Since there's no actual difference between them, there are no rule-like statements to extract. The reasoning doesn't highlight any optimizations or techniques that one uses over the other because they're identical. Therefore, the correct answer should be an empty JSON array.
