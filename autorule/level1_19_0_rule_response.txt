REASONING TRACE:
[
    "- The kernel is compiled with higher optimization flags (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "- The kernel leverages compiler optimizations such as improved instruction scheduling and loop unrolling.",
    "- The kernel reduces runtime overhead through compiler-driven optimizations in memory access patterns."
]


ANSWER:


The reasoning identifies that the primary difference between the kernels is the use of compiler optimization flags (`-O3` in Kernel 2). This leads to the extraction of generalizable rules about compiler optimizations and their impact on CUDA kernel performance. The rules focus on optimization flags, compiler-driven optimizations (e.g., instruction scheduling, loop unrolling), and memory access improvements, which are objective and applicable to other CUDA kernels.
