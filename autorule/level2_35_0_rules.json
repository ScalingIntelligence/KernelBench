  "The kernel avoids vectorized memory accesses when alignment or edge case handling introduces warp divergence.",
  "The kernel uses 1D grid and block configurations for simpler thread scheduling and better GPU occupancy.",
  "The kernel avoids shared memory tiling for small pooling windows to reduce synchronization and data staging overhead.",
  "The kernel uses branch-free operations (e.g., fminf/fmaxf) instead of conditional checks to prevent warp divergence.",
  "The kernel selects thread block sizes that balance register usage and occupancy (e.g., 256 threads per block).",
  "The kernel prioritizes coalesced global memory access patterns over shared memory for small data windows."
