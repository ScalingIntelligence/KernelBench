REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements.

First, the user mentions that Kernel 2 uses a numerical approximation for the softplus function by checking if x is greater than or equal to 20.0f. This allows avoiding expensive operations like expf and log1pf for large values. So the rule here would be about using conditional checks to skip expensive computations when possible.

Next, the compiler flags: Kernel 2 uses -O3, which enables more aggressive optimizations. This is a general practice, so the rule would relate to enabling higher compiler optimization levels.

Then, the thread block configuration. Kernel 2 uses 256 threads per block instead of 1024. The reasoning suggests that smaller block sizes can improve occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks. The rule here would be about selecting thread block sizes that optimize occupancy, possibly considering the GPU's architecture and resource limits.

Now, checking the examples given, the rules should be general and applicable to various CUDA kernels. The three points identified fit this: conditional checks for computational shortcuts, compiler optimizations, and thread block size selection for occupancy.

I need to phrase these as rule-like statements. Let's see:

1. The kernel uses conditional checks to avoid expensive transcendental operations (e.g., expf, log1pf) when input values exceed a certain threshold. (But maybe make it more general, not specific to those functions.)

Wait, the example rules are more general. For instance, Example 1 talks about operator fusion. So the first point here is about avoiding unnecessary computations via conditionals. So perhaps: "The kernel uses conditional checks to skip computationally expensive operations when inputs meet certain criteria."

But the reasoning specifically mentions the softplus approximation for x >=20.0f. So the general rule would be using conditionals to avoid expensive ops when possible.

Second, the compiler flags: "The kernel is compiled with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations."

Third, thread block size: "The kernel uses thread block sizes that optimize occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks on streaming multiprocessors."

But the example given in the problem includes thread block sizes as multiples of warp size. So the third rule here is about block size affecting occupancy. So the rule could be: "The kernel selects thread block sizes that balance occupancy and resource usage for the target architecture."

Alternatively, more precisely: "The kernel uses smaller thread block sizes to improve occupancy and resource utilization on the GPU."

I need to make sure these are objective and deterministic. Let me check each point:

1. Conditional checks to skip expensive operations when possible. That's a general rule. The example in the reasoning uses x >=20.0f, but the rule is about conditionally avoiding ops. So yes.

2. Compiler optimization flags. Enabling higher optimization levels is a general practice.

3. Thread block size selection for occupancy. The reasoning says 256 vs 1024, and that smaller blocks can allow more concurrent blocks. So the rule is about choosing block sizes that improve occupancy.

So the three rules would be:

- The kernel uses conditional checks to avoid expensive transcendental operations when input values exceed a certain threshold.
- The kernel is compiled with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3) to enable aggressive compiler optimizations.
- The kernel uses thread block sizes that optimize occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks on streaming multiprocessors.

Wait, but the first rule mentions "transcendental operations" specifically. The reasoning does mention expf and log1pf, which are transcendental. But maybe the rule can be more general, like "avoid expensive computations when possible via conditional checks". However, the example given in the problem's Example 2 is about shared memory tiling, which is specific. So perhaps being specific is okay here.

Alternatively, rephrase the first rule to be more general: "The kernel uses conditional checks to skip computationally expensive operations when inputs meet certain criteria." That's more general and applies to any expensive ops, not just transcendental.

But the reasoning specifically mentions avoiding expf and log1pf for x >=20.0f. So the rule could be: "The kernel uses conditional checks to bypass expensive mathematical operations when input values are outside a critical range." Hmm, but maybe even more precise.

Alternatively, "The kernel employs numerical approximations to avoid expensive computations for certain input ranges." That's another way. But the key is that the conditional check allows skipping some computations.

Looking back at the examples, they are specific but generalizable. For instance, Example 2 is about shared memory tiling. So the first rule here would be about using conditionals to avoid expensive operations. So perhaps:

- The kernel uses conditional checks to bypass computationally expensive functions for inputs beyond a specific threshold.

But the example in the problem's own examples are more about code structure (fusion, tiling, block sizes). So perhaps the first rule is about optimizing mathematical operations with conditionals.

Alternatively, the answer might have:

1. The kernel uses numerical approximations to avoid expensive computations for inputs beyond a certain threshold.
2. The kernel is compiled with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3).
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that optimize SM occupancy.

But the user's reasoning says "the kernel uses a conditional approximation for softplus", which is a specific case. So the general rule would be using conditionals to skip expensive operations when possible.

So the three rules extracted are:

1. The kernel uses conditional checks to avoid expensive operations when input values exceed a certain threshold.
2. The kernel is compiled with higher optimization levels (e.g., -O3).
3. The kernel uses thread block sizes that optimize occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks.

These are all general and can be applied to various CUDA kernels. The first rule is about conditionally avoiding expensive ops, the second about compiler flags, the third about block size and occupancy.

Now, check if these are rule-like and fit the examples. The examples given in the problem include things like operator fusion, shared memory tiling, thread block sizes as multiples of warp size. The rules here are similar in structure.

Yes, these should be acceptable.
