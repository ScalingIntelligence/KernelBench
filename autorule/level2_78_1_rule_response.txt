REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided to extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be objective and applicable to various CUDA kernels.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses `#pragma unroll` on its inner loops. This is a specific optimization technique where loops are unrolled to reduce overhead. So a rule here would be about loop unrolling.

Next, the use of `__restrict__` keyword in Kernel 2 is highlighted. This keyword tells the compiler that pointers don't alias, allowing better optimizations. That's another rule.

Then, the reasoning talks about precomputing strides for indexing. Kernel 2 calculates strides like `input_stride_c` which simplifies address calculations. This could be a rule about using precomputed strides for memory access efficiency.

Another point is the template specialization with `scalar_t`, but since both kernels use float, this might not be a general rule unless it's about using templates for type optimization. However, the example rules given don't include templating, so maybe this is less critical.

The model architecture difference (MaxPool before fused op) is specific to the model structure, not the kernel itself, so that's probably not a general rule.

The key takeaways mention loop unrolling, `__restrict__`, and strided indexing. These seem to be the main points. The examples provided in the question include things like shared memory tiling and thread block sizes, so similar structural optimizations.

So the rules extracted would be:

1. The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce control flow overhead.
2. The kernel uses the __restrict__ keyword to indicate no pointer aliasing.
3. The kernel precomputes memory access strides for efficient indexing.

These are all objective and can be checked by looking at the code for these features.
