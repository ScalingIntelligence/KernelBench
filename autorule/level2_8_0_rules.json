  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel employs warp shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) for efficient intra-warp reduction instead of shared memory.",
  "The kernel utilizes thread block sizes that match the warp size (32 threads) for optimal occupancy and scheduling.",
  "The kernel processes remaining elements after vectorized loads using a secondary loop to handle non-aligned data sizes.",
  "The kernel avoids synchronization barriers (e.g., __syncthreads()) during reduction steps by leveraging warp-synchronous operations."
