  "The kernel uses vectorized memory accesses (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per thread, improving memory throughput and coalescing.",
  "The kernel replaces division operations with multiplication by a precomputed inverse to reduce computational cost.",
  "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread (e.g., 4 elements) to reduce the total number of threads and blocks needed, improving resource utilization.",
  "The kernel leverages highly optimized library functions (e.g., cuBLAS via nn.Linear) for fused operations like matrix multiplication and bias addition instead of separating them into distinct kernels.",
  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ keyword to enable better compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel handles both aligned (vectorized) and unaligned (scalar) elements in a single implementation to minimize wasted compute for edge cases."
