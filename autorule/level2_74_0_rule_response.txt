REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per thread, reducing global memory transactions.",
    "The kernel replaces conditional branches with intrinsic functions (e.g., fmaxf) to avoid warp divergence.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable pointer aliasing optimizations.",
    "The kernel employs __ldg() intrinsics to cache read-only data in constant or texture memory.",
    "The kernel simplifies index calculations by avoiding expensive integer division and modulus operations.",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads) to improve GPU occupancy.",
    "The kernel utilizes compiler flags like --use_fast_math to enable faster approximate mathematical operations.",
    "The kernel groups memory accesses to consecutive elements to ensure coalesced global memory transactions.",
    "The kernel reduces the total number of threads by processing multiple elements per thread (e.g., via vectorization)."
