Each statement captures a distinct optimization or design choice in Kernel 2 that contributes to its performance advantage over Kernel 1. These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels in general, focusing on aspects like RNG efficiency, memory access patterns, reduction strategies, compiler optimizations, and resource management.",
