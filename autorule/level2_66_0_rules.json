  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel applies dropout once and reuses the result across subsequent passes to avoid redundant computation.",
  "The kernel initializes RNG states once per thread and reuses them, amortizing initialization costs.",
  "The kernel uses block-level shared memory reductions for intermediate results.",
  "The kernel avoids recomputing non-deterministic operations (e.g., dropout masks) across multiple passes.",
  "The kernel utilizes thread block sizes that align with vectorized memory access patterns (e.g., multiples of 4 for float4)."
