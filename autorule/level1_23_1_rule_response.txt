REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids residual element handling by requiring input dimensions to be multiples of the vectorized load size (e.g., 4 elements).",
    "The kernel uses a pure shared memory tree reduction strategy instead of combining warp shuffles and shared memory for reductions.",
    "The kernel minimizes conditional branches by omitting residual element checks, reducing instruction overhead.",
    "The kernel employs a linear code structure without multi-stage reductions, potentially lowering register usage and improving occupancy."
