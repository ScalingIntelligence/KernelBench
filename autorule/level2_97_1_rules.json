  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that allow higher occupancy by enabling more concurrent blocks per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).",
  "The kernel avoids passing frequently accessed scalar parameters via global memory pointers, preferring register-resident scalars.",
  "The kernel uses smaller thread block sizes to improve occupancy and latency hiding despite potential increases in global memory access for shared parameters.",
  "The kernel prioritizes occupancy optimization through block size selection over micro-optimizations like fast math or division-to-multiplication substitution."
