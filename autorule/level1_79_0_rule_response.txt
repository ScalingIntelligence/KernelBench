REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel moves bias addition outside the CUDA kernel to leverage optimized PyTorch operations.",
    "The kernel uses loop ordering that places kernel_size as the outer loop and in_channels as the inner loop to reduce redundant condition checks.",
    "The kernel ensures input and weight tensors are contiguous for optimal memory access patterns.",
    "The kernel checks validity conditions once per kernel_size iteration instead of per (in_channels, kernel_size) pair.",
    "The kernel structures memory accesses to enable coalesced reads/writes by varying in_channels in the inner loop for contiguous input tensor access."
