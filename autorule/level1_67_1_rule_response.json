  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are: \n\n1. **Read-Only Cache Usage**: Explicit use of `__ldg` for input/bias access improves memory efficiency.  \n2. **Coalesced Weight Loading**: Threads load contiguous weight elements into shared memory, maximizing global memory throughput.  \n3. **Output-Coherent Thread Mapping**: Thread/work organization ensures coalesced writes to output memory.  \n4. **Output-Channel Grouping**: Grid structure prioritizes output-channel parallelism, improving shared memory locality and reducing global memory access overhead.  \n\nThese rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.",
