REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses contiguous memory access patterns for coalesced global memory reads.",
    "The kernel avoids synchronization primitives such as __syncthreads() and inter-thread communication.",
    "The kernel employs a grid-stride loop to reduce the number of launched blocks and improve resource utilization.",
    "The kernel eliminates the use of shared memory for partial result storage and intermediate reductions.",
    "The kernel minimizes instruction count by avoiding warp-level reduction operations (e.g., warp shuffles)."

ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses contiguous memory access patterns for coalesced global memory reads.",
    "The kernel avoids synchronization primitives such as __syncthreads() and inter-thread communication.",
    "The kernel employs a grid-stride loop to reduce the number of launched blocks and improve resource utilization.",
    "The kernel eliminates the use of shared memory for partial result storage and intermediate reductions.",
    "The kernel minimizes instruction count by avoiding warp-level reduction operations (e.g., warp shuffles)."
]

These statements capture the key differences in a generalizable, objectively verifiable way that could apply to various CUDA kernels.
