REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses __ldg() intrinsic to leverage the read-only cache for input and parameter accesses.",
    "The kernel replaces conditional branches with fmaxf() for max operations to avoid warp divergence.",
    "The kernel precomputes base indices to reduce redundant index calculations during channel iterations.",
    "The kernel accesses per-channel parameters using read-only cache to enable efficient reuse across threads.",
    "The kernel structures memory accesses to improve coalescing by offsetting base indices with channel strides."

ANSWER:


The JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 is generally faster. These include leveraging the read-only cache with `__ldg()`, avoiding branch divergence via `fmaxf()`, optimizing index calculations, and improving memory coalescing through structured access patterns. These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels broadly.
