REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel avoids shared memory usage to eliminate associated overheads like synchronization and data loading.",
    "The kernel uses loop unrolling pragmas to enable compiler optimizations and reduce loop overhead.",
    "The kernel employs a 1D grid configuration to improve GPU occupancy and simplify thread scheduling.",
    "The kernel accesses global memory with coalesced patterns, leveraging cache locality for small data windows.",
    "The kernel specializes in fixed kernel parameters (e.g., size, stride) to enable compile-time optimizations.",
    "The kernel minimizes control flow complexity by avoiding runtime parameter checks and conditional logic."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning provided. These statements capture the key differences between the two kernels in terms of memory access patterns, execution configuration, loop optimization strategies, and specialization trade-offs. Each rule is formulated to be generalizable to other CUDA kernel optimization scenarios while remaining objectively verifiable.
