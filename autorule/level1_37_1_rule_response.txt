REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses contiguous memory access patterns for coalesced global memory reads.",
    "The kernel employs a two-step hierarchical reduction strategy to minimize atomic operations in the final aggregation step.",
    "The kernel uses smaller thread block sizes to improve GPU occupancy and parallelism.",
    "The kernel avoids grid-strided memory access patterns that lead to non-coalesced memory transactions.",
    "The kernel minimizes the use of atomic operations by preprocessing data into partial sums before final aggregation."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 is faster than Kernel 2. These statements focus on memory access patterns, reduction strategies, block size optimization, and avoidance of inefficient access patterns - all of which are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization. The rules avoid implementation-specific details and maintain objectivity by focusing on measurable characteristics like memory coalescing, atomic operation usage, and block size selection.
