REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let's go through the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively verifiable.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 1 uses vectorized loads/stores with float4. This is a specific technique where each thread handles multiple elements, so a rule here would be about using vectorized memory access with a specific data type. That's a clear, objective statement.

Next, the grid-stride loop pattern is highlighted. The key point is that the kernel processes multiple elements per thread in a loop, which allows handling arbitrary input sizes efficiently. This is a common optimization, so a rule about using grid-stride loops with multiple elements per thread fits.

Then, there's the use of loop unrolling via #pragma unroll. This is a compiler directive that can be checked in the code, so stating that the kernel unrolls loops using pragmas is a valid rule.

The __restrict__ qualifier is mentioned, which helps the compiler optimize by indicating no pointer aliasing. This is another specific code feature that can be identified, so a rule about using __restrict__ for pointers makes sense.

Compiling with -use_fast_math is noted as enabling faster math operations. This is a compiler flag, so a rule about using fast math compiler flags applies here.

Memory coalescing is achieved through vectorized access, leading to better global memory access patterns. The reasoning ties vectorization to coalescing, so a rule about enabling memory coalescing through vectorized access is valid.

Lastly, the kernel is designed to process multiple elements per thread to reduce the total number of threads needed, which affects occupancy. This is a general strategy, so a rule about processing multiple elements per thread to improve occupancy fits.

I need to ensure each rule is a standalone, objective statement without being too specific to the example. Checking the examples given, like operator fusion or shared memory tiling, these are general. The extracted rules here follow that pattern, each highlighting a distinct optimization technique applicable across different kernels.
