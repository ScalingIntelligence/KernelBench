  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array provided contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about the performance differences between the two kernels. Each statement is formulated to be general and applicable to various CUDA kernels, focusing on objectively verifiable and deterministic practices. The rules address boundary condition checks, block size selection, loop unrolling strategies, parameter efficiency, and thread block size optimization. These rules encapsulate the key optimizations identified in Kernel 1 that contribute to its faster execution compared to Kernel 2.",
