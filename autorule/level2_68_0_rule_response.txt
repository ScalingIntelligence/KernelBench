REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a larger thread block size (e.g., 512 threads) to improve occupancy and latency hiding.",
    "The kernel avoids conditional branches for handling edge cases (e.g., remainder elements), preventing warp divergence.",
    "The kernel uses scalar memory access patterns instead of vectorized access (e.g., float4) to simplify code and reduce instruction overhead.",
    "The kernel minimizes register usage by processing fewer elements per thread, allowing higher occupancy.",
    "The kernel launches a higher total number of threads to better leverage GPU parallelism and concurrency."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These statements are generalizable to CUDA kernels and reflect key differences in block size, branch handling, memory access patterns, register usage, and thread utilization.
