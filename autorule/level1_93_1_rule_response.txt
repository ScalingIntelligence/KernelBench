REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized data types (e.g., uchar4) for direct component access to reduce bitwise operations during mask processing.",
    "The kernel avoids bitwise operations for mask value extraction by leveraging structured vector data types.",
    "The kernel supports arbitrary tensor dimensions and memory layouts, including both contiguous and non-contiguous cases.",
    "The kernel includes conditional handling for non-vectorized paths to process remaining elements when dimensions are not multiples of the vector size.",
    "The kernel imposes fewer constraints on input tensor dimensions (e.g., no requirement for divisibility by a specific vector size)."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 outperforms Kernel 2. These statements focus on observable implementation differences related to: 

1. **Vectorization strategy** - Direct component access vs bitwise extraction
2. **Tensor dimension flexibility** - Support for arbitrary shapes vs hardcoded constraints
3. **Memory layout handling** - Graceful fallback to non-vectorized paths
4. **Input requirements** - Avoiding divisibility constraints

These rules can be objectively verified by inspecting kernel code for: 
- Use of vector data types vs bitwise operations
- Presence of dimension checks/constraints
- Conditional handling of edge cases
- Support for stride parameters vs fixed indexing
