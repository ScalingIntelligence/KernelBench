REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses the --use_fast_math compiler flag to enable hardware-optimized approximate math intrinsics.",
    "The kernel employs log1pf(expf(x)) for numerically stable softplus computation, avoiding overflow for large x values.",
    "The kernel is compiled with -O3 optimization level for aggressive compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel avoids additional device guard overhead by omitting CUDAGuard in the CUDA function."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array lists the rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement captures a specific optimization or implementation choice that can be objectively verified (e.g., checking compiler flags, inspecting numerical stability techniques, or analyzing device guard usage). These rules are generalizable to other CUDA kernels, as they focus on compiler directives, numerical stability patterns, optimization levels, and API usage patterns.
