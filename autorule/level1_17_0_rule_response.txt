    "The kernel uses register blocking to increase arithmetic intensity and reduce global memory writes.",
    "The kernel ensures coalesced global memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.",
    "The kernel transposes matrices in shared memory to enable conflict-free access patterns during computation.",
    "The kernel employs larger tile sizes for output matrices to increase data reuse from shared memory.",
    "The kernel utilizes loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enable compiler optimizations.",
    "The kernel is specialized for specific data types and tile sizes to allow better compiler optimization."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These rules focus on optimizations such as **register blocking** to enhance arithmetic intensity, **coalesced memory access** for efficient global memory usage, **shared memory transposition** to avoid bank conflicts, **larger tile sizes** for data reuse, **loop unrolling** to minimize overhead, and **specialization** for targeted hardware optimization. Each rule is objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernels in general, making them valuable for performance tuning.
