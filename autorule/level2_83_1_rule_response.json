  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be objective, deterministic, and applicable to various CUDA kernels.\n\nFirst, looking at the fusion of operations. The reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 fuses GroupNorm with other operations, reducing kernel launches and global memory access. This leads to a rule about operator fusion between multiple operations, similar to the examples given.\n\nNext, the use of efficient reductions. The text describes how Kernel 2 uses warp and block-level reductions with warp shuffles and shared memory. This implies a rule about using warp/block-level reductions with synchronization primitives.\n\nMemory access optimization is another key point. The reasoning highlights better memory coalescing, shared memory reuse, and restrict qualifiers. These can be translated into rules about memory coalescing, shared memory for parameters, and restrict qualifiers for compiler optimizations.\n\nThe RNG section mentions using curand instead of a hash-based approach. This becomes a rule about optimized RNG libraries.\n\nThread utilization is addressed by processing multiple elements per thread and better block configuration. This leads to rules about elements per thread and block/grid configuration.\n\nCompiler optimizations like fast math and -O3 are explicitly mentioned, so those are direct rules.\n\nReduced global memory traffic by keeping intermediates in registers is another point, forming a rule about minimizing global memory access.\n\nI need to ensure each rule is a general statement, not specific to the example. For instance, \"fuses GroupNorm with min/clamp/dropout\" is too specific, so it's generalized to operator fusion. Similarly, using curand becomes using optimized RNG libraries.\n\nChecking against the examples provided, the rules should follow similar structures. Now, compiling all these points into the JSON array as strings.\n",
