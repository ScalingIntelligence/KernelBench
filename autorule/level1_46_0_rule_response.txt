    "The kernel uses sequential division and modulus operations for index decomposition to reduce computational overhead.",
    "The kernel precomputes inverse kernel volume and uses multiplication instead of division for normalization.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns through linearized index calculations to improve cache utilization and coalescing.",
    "The kernel enables higher compiler optimization levels (e.g., -O3) for aggressive instruction scheduling and loop unrolling.",

ANSWER:


Here is the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses sequential division and modulus operations for index decomposition to reduce computational overhead.",
    "The kernel precomputes inverse kernel volume and uses multiplication instead of division for normalization.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns through linearized index calculations to improve cache utilization and coalescing.",
    "The kernel enables higher compiler optimization levels (e.g., -O3) for aggressive instruction scheduling and loop unrolling.",
    "The kernel reduces register pressure through optimized index reuse patterns in calculations."
]

These statements capture the key optimization strategies that made the second kernel faster, expressed as generalizable rules applicable to CUDA kernel development. Each rule is objective and can be verified through code inspection or performance measurements.
