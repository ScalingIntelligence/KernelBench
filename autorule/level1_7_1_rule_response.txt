REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a smaller tile size to reduce shared memory usage per block, allowing higher occupancy.",
    "The kernel avoids loop unrolling that increases register pressure, preserving occupancy.",
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that balance shared memory consumption and occupancy.",
    "The kernel's shared memory access patterns avoid bank conflicts through broadcasting and conflict-free indexing.",
    "The kernel optimizes global memory coalescing by aligning thread access patterns with memory layout."
