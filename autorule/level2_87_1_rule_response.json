  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's break down the reasoning provided. The user is comparing two CUDA kernels and trying to figure out why one is faster. The main points mentioned are:\n\n1. **Fused Subtraction Operations**: Kernel 1 combines two subtractions into one by precomputing the sum of two values on the CPU. This means each thread in the kernel only does one subtraction instead of two. The reasoning here is that reducing the number of arithmetic operations per thread can lead to better performance, especially when scaled across many threads.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Intensity**: Even though a single subtraction is a small operation, when multiplied by millions of threads, the cumulative effect can be significant. Kernel 1 avoids the extra subtraction, thus reducing overall arithmetic intensity.\n\n3. **Parameter Passing**: Kernel 1 passes fewer parameters (one combined value instead of two separate values). While this is considered a minor factor compared to arithmetic operations, it might slightly reduce register pressure or kernel launch overhead.\n\nNow, translating these points into rule-like statements. The key is to make them general and applicable to other CUDA kernels. \n\n- The first point about combining operations on the CPU before the kernel runs can be generalized as fusing operations. So a rule like \"The kernel fuses multiple arithmetic operations into a single operation by precomputing values on the CPU.\"\n\n- The second point about reducing arithmetic operations per thread is a general principle. So a rule like \"The kernel minimizes the number of arithmetic operations per thread to reduce cumulative overhead across parallel threads.\"\n\n- The third point about parameter passing is less emphasized in the reasoning but still mentioned. However, the reasoning downplays its significance. Since the main focus is on arithmetic operations, maybe the parameter count isn't a primary rule here. The user's examples also don't include parameter passing as a rule, so perhaps it's better to exclude it unless it's a major factor.\n\nLooking at the examples provided (operator fusion, shared memory tiling, thread block sizes), they are specific and actionable. The first rule here would align with operator fusion but with a focus on precomputing values on the CPU. The second rule about minimizing arithmetic operations is a general best practice.\n\nSo the final rules extracted would be:\n\n1. The kernel fuses multiple arithmetic operations into a single operation by precomputing values on the CPU.\n2. The kernel minimizes the number of arithmetic operations per thread to reduce cumulative overhead across parallel threads.\n\nI need to check if these are objective and deterministic. The first one is actionable: check if the kernel uses precomputed values to combine operations. The second is about counting arithmetic operations per thread. Both can be verified by examining the kernel code.\n\nTherefore, these two rules are valid and fit the criteria.\n",
