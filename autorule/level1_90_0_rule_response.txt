REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses vectorized memory operations (e.g., float4) to increase memory throughput.",
    "The kernel processes data in a single launch rather than multiple phases requiring separate kernel invocations.",
    "The kernel assigns independent computations (e.g., one row per thread) to maximize thread-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel minimizes global memory traffic by avoiding intermediate global memory stores for partial results.",
    "The kernel employs sequential scan patterns (O(n) operations) instead of parallel scan patterns (O(n log n) operations).",
    "The kernel ensures coalesced memory access patterns by aligning memory operations with thread processing order.",
    "The kernel handles remaining elements after main processing with minimal branching and unrolled loops.",
    "The kernel avoids underutilization of threads by ensuring workload alignment with thread block sizes and grid dimensions.",
    "The kernel reduces synchronization overhead by eliminating unnecessary shared memory barriers and global memory synchronization between phases.",
    "The kernel leverages hardware-supported vectorization for memory operations to reduce instruction count."
