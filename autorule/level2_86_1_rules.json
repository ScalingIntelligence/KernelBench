  "The kernel avoids vectorized memory operations to reduce register pressure and increase thread occupancy.",
  "The kernel processes fewer elements per thread to minimize register usage and improve occupancy.",
  "The kernel eliminates conditional branches for residual element handling to prevent warp divergence.",
  "The kernel uses simpler scalar code to enable better compiler optimizations and instruction scheduling.",
  "The kernel prioritizes higher thread occupancy over vectorized memory access in compute-bound scenarios."
