  "The kernel uses shared memory to store reused data loaded from global memory",
  "The kernel employs a grid configuration that aligns with the data dimensions (e.g., 3D grid for spatial data)",
  "The kernel uses read-only cache via __ldg() intrinsic for loading invariant parameters",
  "The kernel unrolls loops using #pragma unroll to reduce loop overhead",
  "The kernel uses thread block dimensions that enable memory coalescing (e.g., 32x8 blocks where 32 aligns with warp size)",
  "The kernel groups computations along batch/channel dimensions in grid z-dimension for data reuse",
  "The kernel uses compiler flags enabling fast math optimizations (-use_fast_math)"
