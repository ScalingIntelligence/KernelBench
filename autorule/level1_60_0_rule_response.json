  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the analysis of why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These statements are:\n\n1. **Group Specialization** - Kernel 2's design for groups=1 removes group-handling logic, reducing computational overhead.\n2. **Type Specialization** - Explicit use of `float` allows type-specific optimizations rather than generic template code.\n3. **Compiler Optimization** - Use of `-O3` flag enables low-level performance optimizations.\n4. **Loop Ordering** - Input-channel-first loop structure improves memory access patterns.\n5. **Simpler Indexing** - Elimination of group-related arithmetic operations reduces instruction count.\n\nThese rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.",
