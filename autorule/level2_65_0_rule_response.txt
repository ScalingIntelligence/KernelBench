REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses warp shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) for reductions instead of shared memory-based reductions.",
    "The kernel employs a smaller thread block size (e.g., 256 threads) to enable higher occupancy by allowing more concurrent blocks per SM.",
    "The kernel assigns work in warp-centric chunks to ensure consecutive memory access patterns and improve memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage to reduce resource contention and increase the number of concurrent blocks per SM.",
    "The kernel avoids synchronization barriers (e.g., __syncthreads()) during warp-level reductions, reducing synchronization overhead."
