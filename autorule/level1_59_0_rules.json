  "The kernel avoids boundary checks by specializing for parameters that ensure all accesses are within bounds.",
  "The kernel is specialized for fixed parameters (e.g., stride=1, padding=0), eliminating runtime calculations for these values.",
  "The kernel avoids group-related index calculations when groups=1, reducing computational overhead.",
  "The kernel uses regular global memory loads instead of __ldg for data with no reuse across threads.",
  "The kernel separates bias addition into a post-processing step using an optimized element-wise operation."
