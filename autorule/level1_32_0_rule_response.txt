REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses compile-time constants instead of runtime parameters for values that do not change during execution.",
    "The kernel avoids passing parameters that can be hardcoded, reducing register pressure and constant memory accesses.",
    "The kernel enables compiler optimizations such as constant propagation and instruction reordering by using literals instead of variables.",
    "The kernel uses immediate values in floating-point operations instead of loading values from memory."
]


ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about the performance difference between the two kernels. These statements focus on how compile-time constants, parameter handling, and compiler optimizations impact kernel efficiency. They are general enough to apply to other CUDA kernels and emphasize the benefits of hardcoding constants for optimization opportunities, reduced register pressure, and efficient instruction generation.
