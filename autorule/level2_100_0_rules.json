  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access to reduce global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel replaces division operations with precomputed multiplications.",
  "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread to increase arithmetic intensity and hide latency.",
  "The kernel unrolls loops to reduce overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel configures grid size as a multiple of the number of streaming multiprocessors multiplied by 32 to optimize occupancy.",
  "The kernel handles boundary conditions to maintain coalesced memory access patterns."
