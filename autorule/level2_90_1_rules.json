  "The kernel precomputes repeated expressions on the host and passes them as parameters to reduce per-thread arithmetic operations.",
  "The kernel inlines intermediate computations to minimize the use of temporary variables and reduce register pressure.",
  "The kernel minimizes the number of parameters passed to reduce register usage and simplify the kernel interface."
