REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses a larger tile size to reduce the number of global memory accesses and improve data reuse.",
    "The kernel employs vectorized memory operations (e.g., 4-element vectors) to maximize memory bus utilization and reduce global memory transactions.",
    "The kernel optimizes shared memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts through strided accesses.",
    "The kernel aggressively unrolls inner loops to reduce instruction overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations by preventing pointer aliasing.",
    "The kernel increases arithmetic intensity by processing larger sub-tiles per thread (e.g., 4x4 vs 2x2), resulting in more FLOPs per memory operation.",
    "The kernel utilizes transposed matrix handling in shared memory to achieve cache-friendly access patterns during computation."
