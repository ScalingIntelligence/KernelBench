These statements focus on vectorization strategies, memory access patterns, instruction efficiency, and resource utilization, which are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization. Each rule is phrased to be objectively verifiable (e.g., checking for vectorized memory operations, presence of per-element conditionals, or register usage patterns) and applicable to various kernel optimization scenarios.",
