  "The kernel uses the __restrict__ qualifier on input and output pointers to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel omits redundant boundary checks when input dimensions are known to be multiples of the tiling factor, reducing branch instructions.",
  "The kernel leverages compile-time constant division optimization by converting division into multiplication with a precomputed reciprocal where the divisor is a known constant."
