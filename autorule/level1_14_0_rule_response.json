  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the analysis. These rules focus on memory coalescing patterns, thread indexing alignment with memory layouts, and minimization of strided accesses - all critical factors for CUDA kernel performance. The rules are:  \n1. Explicit emphasis on coalesced memory access patterns  \n2. Thread indexing alignment with memory layouts to enable coalescing  \n3. Thread-to-data mapping that preserves memory locality  \n4. Block/grid configuration to support dominant access patterns  \n\nThese rules are generalizable to other CUDA kernels and can be objectively verified by examining memory access patterns and thread indexing strategies.",
