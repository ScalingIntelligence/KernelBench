ANSWER:


The two kernels are functionally identical in terms of CUDA implementation, with no observable differences in:
- Mathematical operations (Swish activation computation)
- Memory access patterns (identical indexing and in-place modification)
- Kernel launch configuration (block/grid dimensions)
- Compiler optimizations (structurally equivalent code)

The reported runtime equivalence (16.3 ms for both) confirms there are no performance-critical differences. No rule-like statements can be derived since no meaningful implementation differences exist to analyze.
