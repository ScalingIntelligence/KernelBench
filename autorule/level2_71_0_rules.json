  "The kernel replaces division operations with multiplication by a precomputed reciprocal to reduce computational cost.",
  "The kernel uses branchless intrinsics (e.g., fmaxf) instead of explicit conditional logic (e.g., ternary operators) to avoid warp divergence.",
  "The kernel precomputes constants outside the kernel to enable compile-time optimizations for arithmetic operations."
