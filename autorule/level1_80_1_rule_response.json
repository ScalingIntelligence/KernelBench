  "response": "\n\nThe reasoning identifies that Kernel 1 avoids storing intermediate values (`ih_base`, `iw_base`) explicitly, reducing register pressure and improving occupancy. This leads to three rule-like statements:  \n1. Avoiding intermediate register storage when recomputing is feasible.  \n2. Minimizing register usage by not hoisting loop-invariant values.  \n3. Prioritizing lower register pressure for higher occupancy over redundant computation.  \n\nThese rules generalize to CUDA kernels where register usage and occupancy are critical factors.",
