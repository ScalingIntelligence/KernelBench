REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel loads input values into shared memory once and reuses them for multiple calculations, reducing global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel uses a thread-per-channel approach with contiguous shared memory storage to enable coalesced memory access during initial load.",
    "The kernel configures thread blocks to match the number of channels, avoiding thread divergence and wasted computation when channel count is less than block size.",
    "The kernel fuses computations by keeping intermediate values in registers or shared memory after initial load, avoiding recomputation with global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel employs a standard parallel reduction in shared memory for better memory bandwidth utilization with smaller data sizes.",
    "The kernel reuses computed values (e.g., exp(val - max_val)) for multiple calculations instead of recomputing them in separate passes."

ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

    "The kernel reuses computed values (e.g., exp(val - max_val)) for multiple calculations instead of recomputing them in separate passes."

These statements are:
1. Objectively verifiable through code inspection
2. Deterministic in nature
3. Generalizable to other CUDA kernels
4. Focused on measurable implementation characteristics
5. Avoid subjective performance claims
6. Based on concrete programming patterns rather than specific numerical results
