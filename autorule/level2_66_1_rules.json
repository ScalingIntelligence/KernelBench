  "The kernel uses warp-level shuffle instructions for reductions instead of shared memory.",
  "The kernel employs a custom random number generator without per-thread state initialization.",
  "The kernel's loop structure ensures consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses for better coalescing.",
  "The kernel is compiled with compiler flags enabling fast math optimizations.",
  "The kernel avoids using shared memory for reductions to improve occupancy.",
  "The kernel uses a deterministic per-element seed for random number generation to enable recomputation without state storage."
