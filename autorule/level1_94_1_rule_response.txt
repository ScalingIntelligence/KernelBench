REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses #pragma unroll on vectorized loops to enable compiler optimizations for instruction-level parallelism.",
    "The kernel employs grid-stride loops for both vectorized and scalar processing to ensure load balancing and memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel avoids clamping the grid size to 65535, allowing more blocks and better parallelism for large inputs.",
    "The kernel initializes memory access patterns to ensure contiguous access within blocks for improved cache utilization."
