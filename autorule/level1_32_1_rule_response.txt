REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses hardcoded constant values for bounds, enabling compile-time optimizations such as constant folding and instruction selection.",
    "The kernel avoids passing additional parameters for bounds, reducing register usage and potential register pressure.",
    "The kernel embeds constant values directly into the instruction stream, eliminating memory accesses for parameter loading.",
    "The kernel allows the compiler to fuse or replace operations (e.g., fmaxf/fminf) with specialized intrinsics when bounds are known at compile time."
