  "response": "\n\nThe reasoning identifies that Kernel 1 uses `--use_fast_math` and `-O3` compiler flags, which optimize mathematical operations and code generation. These are generalizable, objective differences. The inclusion of unnecessary headers in Kernel 2 is also noted as a potential inefficiency. The rules are formatted as concise, deterministic statements applicable to CUDA kernels.",
