  "The kernel replaces division operations with multiplication by precomputing the reciprocal of a scalar value on the host.",
  "The kernel uses fast math intrinsics (e.g., fmaxf) instead of conditional operators (e.g., ternary) to avoid warp divergence.",
  "The kernel specializes for a specific data type (e.g., float) instead of using templated type dispatching, enabling compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel minimizes redundant computations by precalculating invariant values (e.g., scalars) on the host rather than within device code."
