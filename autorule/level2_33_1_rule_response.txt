REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses framework-optimized functions for reductions instead of manual block reductions.",
    "The kernel employs contiguous memory access patterns to enable memory coalescing.",
    "The kernel separates complex operations into multiple specialized phases for optimal tuning.",
    "The kernel uses element-wise operations to maximize parallelism and simplify execution.",
    "The kernel avoids intra-block synchronization requirements to improve occupancy.",
    "The kernel structures grid size based on total elements rather than features for better resource utilization.",
    "The kernel minimizes register pressure by simplifying operations to allow more active thread blocks per SM."
