  "The kernel uses vectorized memory operations (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel replaces modulo operations with bitwise AND for power-of-two dimensions to optimize index calculations.",
  "The kernel processes multiple elements per thread to reduce the total number of threads and improve occupancy.",
  "The kernel employs wider memory transactions (e.g., 128-bit) to enhance memory bandwidth utilization and coalescing."
