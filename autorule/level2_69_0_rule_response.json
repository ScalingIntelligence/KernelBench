These rules focus on memory access patterns, constant usage, and in-place operation avoidance, which are generalizable to other CUDA kernel optimizations.\n\nKey rules extracted:\n1. **Read-only memory access** - Highlights the importance of const qualifiers for enabling read-only cache optimizations\n2. **Explicit float constants** - Emphasizes proper constant typing to enable compiler optimizations\n3. **In-place modification avoidance** - Suggests separating input/output buffers for better memory access patterns\n\nThese rules are objective and can be deterministically applied to analyze other CUDA kernels.",
