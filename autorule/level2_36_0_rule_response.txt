REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses separate kernels for reduction and element-wise operations to maximize thread utilization.",
    "The kernel avoids underutilization of threads by ensuring all threads participate in element-wise operations.",
    "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 256 threads) to improve SM occupancy and latency hiding.",
    "The kernel ensures that element-wise operations are parallelized across all threads rather than restricting them to a single thread per block.",
    "The kernel prioritizes thread utilization over fusing operations when fusion leads to significant thread underutilization."

ANSWER:


Here is the analysis of the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

1. **Separation of Reduction and Element-Wise Operations**  
   Kernel 1 splits the workload into two kernels: one for reductions (min/sum) and another for GELU + bias. This ensures full thread utilization during the element-wise phase, unlike Kernel 2, where only one thread per block computes GELU.

2. **Thread Utilization in Element-Wise Operations**  
   Kernel 1’s GELU kernel uses all threads for parallel computation, while Kernel 2 serializes GELU within a block (only thread 0 active). This highlights the importance of avoiding thread underutilization in fused kernels.

3. **Block Size Optimization**  
   Kernel 1 uses larger block sizes (256 threads) for better SM occupancy, whereas Kernel 2’s block size depends on problem-specific dimensions (e.g., H=128), leading to smaller blocks and lower occupancy.

4. **Avoiding Fusion-Induced Underutilization**  
   While Kernel 2 fuses operations to reduce global memory traffic, the severe thread underutilization during GELU outweighs the memory savings. This emphasizes that fusion is not always beneficial if it sacrifices parallelism.

5. **Balancing Fusion and Parallelism**  
   The tradeoff between fusion (reducing memory operations) and thread utilization is critical. Kernel 1 prioritizes parallelism over fusion, demonstrating that split kernels can outperform fused ones when thread utilization is compromised.
