  "reasoning_trace": "Okay, let's go through the reasoning provided and extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels, so I need to focus on the underlying principles rather than specifics of the matrix multiplication example.\n\nFirst, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access. That's a clear rule, similar to Example 2 provided. So that's one rule.\n\nThen, the analysis points out that Kernel 2 loads tiles into shared memory with coalesced global memory reads. Coalesced memory access is a general optimization, so another rule would be about using coalesced global memory accesses.\n\nThe reduction in global memory accesses by a factor of the tile size (TILE_SIZE) implies that data reuse is achieved through shared memory. So data reuse via tiling is another point.\n\nThe reasoning also mentions that Kernel 1 has non-coalesced accesses for matrix B due to strided accesses. So avoiding strided global memory accesses (or ensuring contiguous access patterns) is another rule.\n\nAdditionally, the use of shared memory to leverage on-chip memory for faster access and lower latency is highlighted. This relates to utilizing shared memory to minimize global memory dependency.\n\nThread block configuration is mentioned, but both kernels use 16x16 blocks. However, the key point is that Kernel 2's tiling aligns with GPU memory hierarchy. The example given in the problem includes a rule about thread block sizes being multiples of warp size. While the reasoning here doesn't mention warp size specifically, the alignment with memory hierarchy through tiling could be a more general rule about optimizing thread block configuration for memory hierarchy.\n\nPutting this together, the rules would be:\n\n1. Using shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.\n2. Ensuring coalesced global memory accesses when loading data.\n3. Reusing data loaded into shared memory multiple times.\n4. Avoiding non-coalesced (strided) global memory accesses.\n5. Leveraging shared memory to minimize global memory latency.\n6. Aligning thread block configuration with GPU memory hierarchy for better bandwidth utilization.\n\nI need to check if these are stated as general rules. The reasoning explicitly mentions shared memory tiling, coalesced accesses, data reuse via tiling, and avoiding strided accesses. The thread block alignment is a bit more specific to the example but can be generalized. However, the example given in the problem includes a rule about thread block sizes and warp size, which isn't directly mentioned here. The key here is to extract only the rules that are clearly implied by the reasoning provided.\n\nSo the final list would include the rules that are explicitly mentioned in the reasoning, such as using shared memory tiling, coalesced accesses, data reuse through tiling, avoiding strided accesses, and leveraging shared memory. The thread block configuration point might be too specific unless the reasoning clearly states it as a general rule. The reasoning's \"Key Speedup Factors\" mention coalesced memory patterns and reduced memory latency via shared memory, which supports the rules. The thread block part in the reasoning says \"better aligned with GPU memory hierarchy,\" which can be a general rule about thread block configuration optimizing memory hierarchy usage.\n\nTherefore, the JSON array should include these rules as general statements applicable to CUDA kernels.\n",
