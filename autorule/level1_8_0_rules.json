  "The kernel uses subtile computation where each thread processes multiple output elements to increase arithmetic intensity.",
  "The kernel employs larger tile sizes to reduce the number of outer loop iterations and shared memory operations.",
  "The kernel structures global memory accesses to enable coalesced transactions through contiguous data loading patterns.",
  "The kernel transposes matrix data in shared memory to minimize bank conflicts during computation phases.",
  "The kernel aggressively unrolls inner loops to reduce instruction overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel configures thread block dimensions to optimize occupancy while maintaining high per-thread workload."
