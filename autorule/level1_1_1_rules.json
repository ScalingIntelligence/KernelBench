  "The kernel uses a larger tile size to increase data reuse from shared memory.",
  "The kernel employs sub-tiling (register blocking) where each thread computes a submatrix to increase arithmetic intensity.",
  "The kernel utilizes shared memory padding to avoid bank conflicts.",
  "The kernel ensures coalesced global memory access patterns for efficient data loading.",
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction scheduling.",
  "The kernel transposes matrix access patterns in shared memory to optimize memory access during computation.",
  "The kernel employs register tiling to hold intermediate sums, reducing shared memory traffic.",
  "The kernel uses thread block configurations that optimize occupancy and resource usage.",
  "The kernel applies the __restrict__ qualifier to pointers to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel increases per-thread workload through submatrix computation, reducing the total number of threads needed."
