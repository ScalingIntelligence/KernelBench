  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
  "The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.",
  "The kernel accesses global memory in a coalesced pattern for both input matrices.",
  "The kernel's grid configuration aligns with the output matrix dimensions to minimize overhead.",
  "The kernel optimizes for small K dimensions by reducing loop iterations and leveraging shared memory efficiently."
