  "The kernel uses vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to reduce global memory transactions.",
  "The kernel implements a hierarchical scan strategy with thread-level and block-level scans.",
  "The kernel eliminates boundary checks by ensuring input dimensions meet specific divisibility requirements.",
  "The kernel stores intermediate results in register memory for local computations.",
  "The kernel uses shared memory efficiently for block-level scans with minimal storage requirements.",
  "The kernel employs explicit loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel avoids conditional branches during memory access operations."
