  "The kernel uses loop unrolling via pragmas for loops with compile-time known bounds.",
  "The kernel precomputes memory access pointers and strides to reduce index calculation overhead.",
  "The kernel employs __restrict__ qualifiers to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations by indicating non-aliasing pointers.",
  "The kernel uses fixed, compile-time constant kernel sizes to allow constant propagation and dead code elimination.",
  "The kernel structures memory accesses to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses for coalescing.",
  "The kernel moves conditional operations (e.g., bias addition) outside the main computation to avoid branch divergence.",
  "The kernel specializes data types (e.g., hardcoding float) rather than using templates to enable compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel utilizes aggressive compiler optimization flags (-O3, -use_fast_math) for enhanced performance.",
  "The kernel optimizes index calculations by replacing divisions and modulo operations with precomputed strides.",
  "The kernel separates computationally intensive operations (e.g., convolution) from simpler ones (e.g., bias addition) into distinct kernels."
