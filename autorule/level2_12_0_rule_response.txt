REASONING TRACE:

ANSWER:


The two kernels provided are identical in both their CUDA implementation and PyTorch model code. The observed runtime difference (6.98 ms vs. 6.99 ms) is within the margin of measurement noise and does not reflect a meaningful performance difference. No rule-like statements can be extracted from the reasoning because the kernels are structurally and functionally the same.
