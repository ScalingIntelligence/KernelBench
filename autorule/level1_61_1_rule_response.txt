REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel orders loops such that input channel iterations are inner loops, enabling contiguous memory access for input tensors.",
    "The kernel is compiled with aggressive compiler optimization flags (e.g., -O3).",
    "The kernel precomputes and reuses spatial index calculations to reduce redundant computations.",
    "The kernel prioritizes input tensor memory access patterns over weight tensor access patterns when loop ordering."

ANSWER:


The JSON array above captures the key rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. These rules are: 

1. **Input Channel Inner Loops**: Kernel 1's loop ordering (input channels as inner loops) enables contiguous memory access for input tensors, which is critical for coalescing.  
2. **Compiler Optimization Flags**: Explicit use of `-O3` in Kernel 1 enables deeper compiler optimizations compared to default settings.  
3. **Spatial Index Precomputation**: Precomputing spatial indices reduces redundant calculations and register pressure.  
4. **Input Access Prioritization**: Kernel 1 prioritizes input tensor access patterns (via loop order) over weight tensor locality, as input size dominates performance.  

These rules are objective, deterministic, and applicable to CUDA kernel optimization in general.
