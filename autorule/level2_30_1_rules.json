  "The kernel avoids redundant __syncthreads() calls by computing normalization statistics redundantly in all threads instead of using shared memory for synchronization.",
  "The kernel precomputes division operations on the host and replaces them with multiplications by precomputed inverses in the kernel.",
  "The kernel minimizes shared memory usage to improve occupancy and allow more concurrent blocks per SM.",
  "The kernel uses block dimensions that align with vectorized memory access patterns (e.g., features_per_group/2 for float2 loads/stores)."
