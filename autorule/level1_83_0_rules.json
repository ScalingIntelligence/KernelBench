  "The kernel uses shared memory tiling to reduce global memory access.",
  "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
  "The kernel uses loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.",
  "The kernel uses the __ldg() intrinsic to leverage the read-only data cache for global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no pointer aliasing.",
  "The kernel employs cooperative loading of data into shared memory within a thread block.",
  "The kernel uses a grid configuration that groups related computations (e.g., batch and channel) to improve data locality.",
  "The kernel reduces thread divergence by minimizing conditional branching within threads.",
  "The kernel organizes threads to enable coalesced global memory accesses by aligning with data dimensions."
