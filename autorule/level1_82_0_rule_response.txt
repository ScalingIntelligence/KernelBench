REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses registers instead of shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce latency and synchronization overhead.",
    "The kernel fully unrolls loops with known iteration counts using #pragma unroll to eliminate loop control overhead.",
    "The kernel employs a 1D grid layout to ensure coalesced global memory accesses for both reads and writes.",
    "The kernel specializes for fixed-size operations (e.g., 3x3 kernels) to enable compile-time optimizations and boundary check elimination.",
    "The kernel uses linear thread indexing patterns to maintain spatial locality in memory accesses.",
    "The kernel minimizes synchronization points by avoiding inter-thread communication requirements.",
    "The kernel optimizes grid dimensionality (1D vs 3D) to reduce arithmetic overhead in index calculations."

ANSWER:


The JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 1 outperforms Kernel 2. These statements focus on objective CUDA optimization strategies like register usage, loop unrolling, memory access patterns, and grid configuration. Each rule is formulated to be generalizable across different CUDA kernels while remaining specific enough for deterministic evaluation.
