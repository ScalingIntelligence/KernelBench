  "response": "\n\nThe two CUDA kernels provided are **identical** in code structure, memory access patterns, and kernel launch configurations. Both use the same block size (256 threads per block), same grid size calculation, and identical arithmetic operations. The key operations (distance calculations and max with margin) are the same. \n\nThe observed runtime difference (0.0952 ms vs. 0.0944 ms) is **within the range of measurement noise** typical for GPU executions. Factors like GPU thermal throttling, background processes, or slight variations in memory alignment during tensor creation could cause such minor discrepancies. \n\n**Conclusion**: There is no algorithmic or implementation difference between the kernels. The runtime variation is due to external/system-level factors, not the code itself.\n\n[]",
