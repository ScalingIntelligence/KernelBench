  "The kernel uses const qualifiers for variables to enable compiler optimizations such as better register allocation.",
  "The kernel avoids using log1pf in favor of logf with explicit arithmetic operations when numerical precision for small values is not critical.",
  "The kernel declares loop or thread-specific variables as const to reduce register pressure and improve instruction scheduling."
