  "The kernel uses shared memory to cache weights and reduce global memory access.",
  "The kernel processes consecutive memory positions with adjacent threads to enable coalesced global memory accesses.",
  "The kernel uses __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.",
  "The kernel uses __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data access to leverage texture cache.",
  "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes combined with loop unrolling to increase parallelism and hide memory latency.",
  "The kernel separates bias addition from the main computation to avoid conditional branching within the loop.",
  "The kernel uses a 1D grid layout to improve memory access patterns compared to higher-dimensional grids.",
  "The kernel enables compiler flags like -use_fast_math for faster mathematical operations at the expense of some precision."
