ANSWER:


Here's the JSON array of rule-like statements derived from the reasoning:

[
    "The kernel uses in-place operations to reduce global memory traffic.",
    "The kernel flattens multiple dimensions into a single contiguous dimension to enable coalesced memory access.",
    "The kernel simplifies index calculations by precomputing aggregated dimensions to reduce arithmetic operations.",
    "The kernel enforces tensor contiguity and data type constraints to ensure optimal memory layout.",
    "The kernel avoids strided memory accesses by restructuring multidimensional indices into contiguous flattened indices."
]

These statements capture the key optimization principles observed in the faster kernel while maintaining generality for application to other CUDA kernels. Each rule can be objectively verified by checking: 1) presence of in-place modifications, 2) dimension flattening patterns, 3) index calculation complexity, 4) explicit memory layout constraints, and 5) memory access stride patterns.
