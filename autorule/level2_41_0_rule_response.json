  "response": "\n\nThe provided code for both kernels is **identical**, which means there should be no performance difference between them. The observed runtime variance (30.6 ms vs 30.9 ms) is likely due to external factors such as system noise, measurement variability, or non-deterministic GPU scheduling. \n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Kernel Code:** Both CUDA kernels use the same:\n   - Block size (256 threads)\n   - Memory access patterns (`idx % out_features`)\n   - Fused operations (BatchNorm + GELU + ReLU)\n   - Compilation flags (`-O3`, `--use_fast_math`)\n\n2. **Python Logic:** The `ModelNew` class and data preparation are identical in both cases, including:\n   - Batch statistics computation\n   - Scale/shift derivation\n   - Kernel launch parameters\n\n**Possible Explanations for Timing Variance:**\n- GPU warm-up effects\n- Background processes\n- Non-deterministic GPU behavior (e.g., clock throttling)\n- Measurement error\n\n**Recommendation:** To ensure accurate benchmarking:\n1. Use `torch.cuda.synchronize()` before timing\n2. Run multiple iterations and average\n3. Ensure consistent GPU clock speeds\n\nWithout actual code differences, the performance gap likely falls within normal measurement variability for GPU computations.",
