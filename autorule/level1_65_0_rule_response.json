  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array contains rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why one kernel is faster than the other. These statements focus on memory access patterns, loop ordering, thread block organization, and cache utilization - all of which are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization across different implementations. The rules are formulated to be objectively verifiable through code inspection and memory access pattern analysis.",
