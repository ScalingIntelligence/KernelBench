  "response": "\n\nThe JSON array lists three rule-like statements derived from the reasoning. Each statement captures a distinct optimization strategy applied in the faster kernel (Kernel 2) compared to Kernel 1. These rules are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization and can be objectively verified by examining the kernel code for the presence of loop unrolling pragmas, boundary check conditions, and data type specialization.",
  "reasoning_trace": "[\n    \"The kernel uses loop unrolling via #pragma unroll on the inner computation loop to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.\",\n    \"The kernel omits boundary checks during shared memory tile loading when input dimensions are known to be multiples of the tile size, reducing branch instructions.\",\n    \"The kernel is specialized for a specific data type (e.g., float) rather than using a templated dispatch, enabling compiler optimizations tailored to the data type.\"\n]\n",
