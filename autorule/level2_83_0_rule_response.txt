REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel performs operator fusion between multiple operations to reduce kernel launch overhead and intermediate global memory accesses.",
    "The kernel uses shared memory to store intermediate values (e.g., mean, variance) for faster access during computation.",
    "The kernel employs block-level and warp-level reductions for efficient computation of statistical values (e.g., sum, variance).",
    "The kernel utilizes a grid configuration aligned with data dimensions (e.g., groups, batches) to improve data locality and parallelism.",
    "The kernel optimizes memory access patterns through strided loops and coalesced memory operations for spatial dimensions.",
    "The kernel reuses initialized random number generator states across multiple elements per thread for dropout operations.",
    "The kernel applies compiler optimizations (e.g., --use_fast_math, -O3) for faster mathematical approximations and loop unrolling."
