  "response": "\n\nThe two kernels are functionally identical in terms of CUDA implementation, with no observable differences in:\n- Mathematical operations (Swish activation computation)\n- Memory access patterns (identical indexing and in-place modification)\n- Kernel launch configuration (block/grid dimensions)\n- Compiler optimizations (structurally equivalent code)\n\nThe reported runtime equivalence (16.3 ms for both) confirms there are no performance-critical differences. No rule-like statements can be derived since no meaningful implementation differences exist to analyze.",
