  "The kernel uses numerically stable formulations of mathematical operations to avoid overflow or underflow.",
  "The kernel replaces logf(1.0f + y) with log1pf(y) for improved accuracy and performance.",
  "The kernel avoids intermediate operations that may produce infinities or NaNs by re-expressing computations in terms of bounded functions.",
  "The kernel utilizes CUDA intrinsic functions (e.g., fmaxf, log1pf) for branchless and optimized execution."
