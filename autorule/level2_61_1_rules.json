  "The kernel combines multiple operations into a single kernel launch to reduce overhead.",
  "The kernel uses shared memory to store intermediate reduction results (e.g., sum, sum of squares) instead of global memory.",
  "The kernel leverages cache locality by keeping intermediate data in L1/L2 cache across fused operations within the same kernel.",
  "The kernel minimizes global memory traffic by avoiding redundant writes and reads of intermediate values between separate kernel launches.",
  "The kernel dynamically allocates shared memory based on thread block requirements for efficient resource utilization."
