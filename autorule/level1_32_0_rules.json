  "The kernel uses compile-time constants instead of runtime parameters for values that do not change during execution.",
  "The kernel avoids passing parameters that can be hardcoded, reducing register pressure and constant memory accesses.",
  "The kernel enables compiler optimizations such as constant propagation and instruction reordering by using literals instead of variables.",
  "The kernel uses immediate values in floating-point operations instead of loading values from memory."
