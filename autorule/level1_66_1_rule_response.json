  "response": "\n\nThe provided JSON array lists rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about why Kernel 2 outperforms Kernel 1. These rules focus on loop ordering, memory access patterns, and data type handling, which are generalizable to CUDA kernel optimization. Each rule emphasizes deterministic, observable properties (e.g., loop order, memory layout alignment) that can be objectively verified in code.",
