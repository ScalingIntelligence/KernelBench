REASONING TRACE:
Okay, let me parse through the reasoning provided to extract the rule-like statements. The user wants these rules to be general enough for various CUDA kernels and objectively verifiable.

First, the reasoning mentions that Kernel 2 flattens spatial dimensions into DHW, leading to contiguous memory access. This suggests a rule about flattening dimensions for coalescing. So: "The kernel flattens multiple spatial dimensions into a single dimension to enable contiguous memory access."

Next, the index calculation in Kernel 2 is simpler, using division and modulo once instead of multiple times. The rule here would be about reducing arithmetic operations for indices: "The kernel minimizes the number of division and modulo operations for index calculations."

Kernel 2 uses a larger thread block size (512 vs 256). The example given in the problem includes thread block sizes as a rule. So: "The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads per block) to improve SM occupancy."

Fewer parameters in Kernel 2 reduce register usage. This leads to: "The kernel reduces the number of parameters passed to decrease register pressure."

Eliminating redundant calculations by precomputing DHW. So: "The kernel precomputes combined dimensions (e.g., DHW) to avoid redundant calculations during index computation."

Simpler address calculation helps the compiler optimize. But this might be too vague. However, the precomputing part is more concrete. So the previous point covers that.

Checking the examples given, these rules fit the format. They are specific, objective, and applicable to other kernels. I need to ensure each rule is a separate statement and doesn't overlap. Let me list them out:

1. The kernel flattens multiple spatial dimensions into a single dimension to enable contiguous memory access.
2. The kernel minimizes the number of division and modulo operations for index calculations.
3. The kernel uses larger thread block sizes (e.g., 512 threads per block) to improve SM occupancy.
4. The kernel reduces the number of parameters passed to decrease register pressure.
5. The kernel precomputes combined dimensions (e.g., DHW) to avoid redundant calculations during index computation.

These all seem to fit the criteria. Let me verify against the reasoning text to ensure I didn't miss any. The key points were memory coalescing via flattening, simpler index math, larger block size, fewer parameters, and precomputed dimensions. Yes, these five rules cover those points.
