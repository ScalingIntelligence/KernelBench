REASONING TRACE:
[
    "The kernel uses thread block sizes that are multiples of warp size (32).",
    "The kernel uses a fixed thread block size (256) to optimize occupancy regardless of input dimensions.",
    "The kernel avoids using small thread block sizes (e.g., less than 32) that lead to underutilized warps and reduced occupancy.",
    "The kernel configures thread block sizes independently of channel dimensions when processing spatial data."

ANSWER:


The JSON array provided includes rule-like statements derived from the reasoning about the performance difference between the two CUDA kernels. These rules focus on thread block configuration, occupancy optimization, and independence from input dimensions, which are generalizable to other CUDA kernels.
