# KernelBench project

See original [KernelBench repo](https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench). Original README is [KernelBench.md](KernelBench.md).

### Test-time Scaling methods
Implementations of test-time scaling methods are in `main` directory. The following methods are implemented:

- Best-of-N (KernelBench): sample $N$ independent kernels and pick best performance.
- Iterative Refinement (KernelBench): sample kernel and get execution feedback to iteratively refine for $N$ steps.
- [METR](https://metr.org/blog/2025-02-14-measuring-automated-kernel-engineering/): Initially, independently generate $N_0$ kernels. New kernel is generated by sampling based on efficiency from previously generated kernels and evolving it. Repeat until $N$ kernels total.
- [Stanford (Beam-search)](https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/blogs/fastkernels/): From current kernel, generate $P$ independent NL ideas -> kernel. Pick best performing kernel to use for the next step. Repeat for $N$ steps.
